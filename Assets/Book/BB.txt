* ALCOHOLICS\nANONYMOUS\n\nTHE DOCTOR’S OPINION\n\nWE OF Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the\nreader will be interested in the medical estimate of\nthe plan of recovery described in this book. Convincing\ntestimony must surely come from medical men who have\nhad experience with the sufferings of our members and\nhave witnessed our return to health. A well-known doctor,\nchief physician at a nationally prominent hospital\nspecializing in alcoholic and drug addiction, gave Alcoholics\nAnonymous this letter:\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI have specialized in the treatment of alcoholism for\nmany years.\n\nIn late 1934 I attended a patient who, though he had\nbeen a competent businessman of good earning capacity,\nwas an alcoholic of a type I had come to regard as\nhopeless.\n\nIn the course of his third treatment he acquired certain\nideas concerning a possible means of recovery. As part\nof his rehabilitation he commenced to present his conceptions\nto other alcoholics, impressing upon them that\nthey must do likewise with still others. This has become\nthe basis of a rapidly growing fellowship of these men\nand their families. This man and over one hundred others\nappear to have recovered.\n\nI personally know scores of cases who were of the type\nwith whom other methods had failed completely.\nThese facts appear to be of extreme medical importance;\nbecause of the extraordinary possibilities of rapid\n\nxviii\n\n\ngrowth inherent in this group they may mark a new\n\nepoch in the annals of alcoholism. These men may well\n\nhave a remedy for thousands of such situations.\n\nYou may rely absolutely on anything they say about\n\nthemselves.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n William D. Silkworth, M.D.\n\nThe physician who, at our request, gave us this letter,\nhas been kind enough to enlarge upon his views in another\nstatement which follows. In this statement he confirms\nwhat we who have suffered alcoholic torture must believe—\nthat the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal\nas his mind. It did not satisfy us to be told that we could\nnot control our drinking just because we were maladjusted\nto life, that we were in full flight from reality, or were\noutright mental defectives. These things were true to some\nextent, in fact, to a considerable extent with some of us.\nBut we are sure that our bodies were sickened as well. In\nour belief, any picture of the alcoholic which leaves out\nthis physical factor is incomplete.\n\nThe doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol\ninterests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness\nmay, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem drinkers,\nwe can say that his explanation makes good sense. It\nexplains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.\n\n\nThough we work out our solution on the spiritual as\nwell as an altruistic plane, we favor hospitalization\nfor the alcoholic who is very jittery or befogged. More\noften than not, it is imperative that a man’s brain be\ncleared before he is approached, as he has then a bet\n\n\n\nter chance of understanding and accepting what we have\n\nto offer.\nThe doctor writes:\n\nThe subject presented in this book seems to me to be of\n\nparamount importance to those afflicted with alcoholic\n\naddiction.\n\nI say this after many years’ experience as Medical Di\n\n\nrector of one of the oldest hospitals in the country treat\n\n\ning alcoholic and drug addiction.\n\nThere was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when\n\nI was asked to contribute a few words on a subject which\n\nis covered in such masterly detail in these pages.\n\nWe doctors have realized for a long time that some\nform of moral psychology was of urgent importance to\nalcoholics, but its application presented difficulties beyond\nour conception. What with our ultra-modern standards,\nour scientific approach to everything, we are perhaps\nnot well equipped to apply the powers of good that\nlie outside our synthetic knowledge.\n\nMany years ago one of the leading contributors to this\nbook came under our care in this hospital and while here\nhe acquired some ideas which he put into practical application\nat once.\n\nLater, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell\nhis story to other patients here and with some misgiving,\nwe consented. The cases we have followed through have\nbeen most interesting; in fact, many of them are amazing.\nThe unselfishness of these men as we have come to\nknow them, the entire absence of profit motive, and\ntheir community spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who\nhas labored long and wearily in this alcoholic field. They\nbelieve in themselves, and still more in the Power which\npulls chronic alcoholics back from the gates of death.\n\nOf course an alcoholic ought to be freed from his physical\n\n\ncraving for liquor, and this often requires a definite hospital\nprocedure, before psychological measures can be of\nmaximum benefit.\n\nWe believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the\naction of alcohol on these chronic alcoholics is a manifestation\nof an allergy; that the phenomenon of craving\nis limited to this class and never occurs in the average\ntemperate drinker. These allergic types can never safely\nuse alcohol in any form at all; and once having formed\nthe habit and found they cannot break it, once having\nlost their self-confidence, their reliance upon things human,\ntheir problems pile up on them and become astonishingly\ndifficult to solve.\n\nFrothy emotional appeal seldom suffices. The message\nwhich can interest and hold these alcoholic people\nmust have depth and weight. In nearly all cases, their\nideals must be grounded in a power greater than themselves,\nif they are to re-create their lives.\n\nIf any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for\nalcoholics we appear somewhat sentimental, let them stand\nwith us a while on the firing line, see the tragedies, the\ndespairing wives, the little children; let the solving of these\nproblems become a part of their daily work, and even of\ntheir sleeping moments, and the most cynical will not wonder\nthat we have accepted and encouraged this movement.\nWe feel, after many years of experience, that we have\nfound nothing which has contributed more to the rehabilitation\nof these men than the altruistic movement now\ngrowing up among them.\n\nMen and women drink essentially because they like the\neffect produced by alcohol. The sensation is so elusive that,\nwhile they admit it is injurious, they cannot after a time\ndifferentiate the true from the false. To them, their alcoholic\nlife seems the only normal one. They are restless,\nirritable and discontented, unless they can again experience\n\n\nthe sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by\ntaking a few drinks—drinks which they see others taking\nwith impunity. After they have succumbed to the desire\nagain, as so many do, and the phenomenon of craving\ndevelops, they pass through the well-known stages of a\nspree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution not to\ndrink again. This is repeated over and over, and unless\nthis person can experience an entire psychic change there\nis very little hope of his recovery.\n\nOn the other hand—and strange as this may seem to\nthose who do not understand—once a psychic change has\noccurred, the very same person who seemed doomed, who\nhad so many problems he despaired of ever solving them,\nsuddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for\nalcohol, the only effort necessary being that required to\nfollow a few simple rules.\n\nMen have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal:\n“Doctor, I cannot go on like this! I have everything to live\nfor! I must stop, but I cannot! You must help me!”\n\nFaced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with\nhimself, he must sometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although\nhe gives all that is in him, it often is not enough.\nOne feels that something more than human power is\nneeded to produce the essential psychic change. Though\nthe aggregate of recoveries resulting from psychiatric\neffort is considerable, we physicians must admit we have\nmade little impression upon the problem as a whole.\nMany types do not respond to the ordinary psychological\napproach.\n\nI do not hold with those who believe that alcoholism is\nentirely a problem of mental control. I have had many\nmen who had, for example, worked a period of months on\nsome problem or business deal which was to be settled on a\ncertain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day or\nso prior to the date, and then the phenomenon of craving\nat once became paramount to all other interests so that the\n\n\nxxviii THE DOCTOR’S OPINION\nimportant appointment was not met. These men were\nnot drinking to escape; they were drinking to overcome\na craving beyond their mental control.\nThere are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon\nof craving which cause men to make the supreme\nsacrifice rather than continue to fight.\nThe classification of alcoholics seems most difficult,\nand in much detail is outside the scope of this book. There\nare, of course, the psychopaths who are emotionally unstable.\nWe are all familiar with this type. They are always\n“going on the wagon for keeps.” They are over-remorseful\nand make many resolutions, but never a decision.\nThere is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that he\ncannot take a drink. He plans various ways of drinking. He\nchanges his brand or his environment. There is the type\nwho always believes that after being entirely free from alcohol\nfor a period of time he can take a drink without\ndanger. There is the manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps,\nthe least understood by his friends, and about whom a\nwhole chapter could be written.\nThen there are types entirely normal in every respect\nexcept in the effect alcohol has upon them. They are often\nable, intelligent, friendly people.\nAll these, and many others, have one symptom in common:\nthey cannot start drinking without developing the\nphenomenon of craving. This phenomenon, as we have\nsuggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy which\ndifferentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct\nentity. It has never been, by any treatment with which we\nare familiar, permanently eradicated. The only relief we\nhave to suggest is entire abstinence.\nThis immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron\nof debate. Much has been written pro and con, but among\nphysicians, the general opinion seems to be that most\nchronic alcoholics are doomed.\n\n\nTHE DOCTOR’S OPINION xxix\n\nWhat is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this\nby relating one of my experiences.\n\nAbout one year prior to this experience a man was\nbrought in to be treated for chronic alcoholism. He had\nbut partially recovered from a gastric hemorrhage and\nseemed to be a case of pathological mental deterioration.\nHe had lost everything worthwhile in life and was\nonly living, one might say, to drink. He frankly admitted\nand believed that for him there was no hope. Following\nthe elimination of alcohol, there was found to be no\npermanent brain injury. He accepted the plan outlined in\nthis book. One year later he called to see me, and I\nexperienced a very strange sensation. I knew the man by\nname, and partly recognized his features, but there all\nresemblance ended. From a trembling, despairing, nervous\nwreck, had emerged a man brimming over with self-\nreliance and contentment. I talked with him for some\ntime, but was not able to bring myself to feel that I had\nknown him before. To me he was a stranger, and so he left\nme. A long time has passed with no return to alcohol.\n\nWhen I need a mental uplift, I often think of another\ncase brought in by a physician prominent in New York.\nThe patient had made his own diagnosis, and deciding his\nsituation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted barn determined\nto die. He was rescued by a searching party, and, in\ndesperate condition, brought to me. Following his physical\nrehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he\nfrankly stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort,\nunless I could assure him, which no one ever had,\nthat in the future he would have the “will power” to\nresist the impulse to drink.\n\nHis alcoholic problem was so complex, and his depression\nso great, that we felt his only hope would be through\nwhat we then called “moral psychology,” and we doubted\nif even that would have any effect.\n\n\nHowever, he did become “sold” on the ideas contained\nin this book. He has not had a drink for a great many\nyears. I see him now and then and he is as fine a specimen\nof manhood as one could wish to meet.\n\nI earnestly advise every alcoholic to read this book\nthrough, and though perhaps he came to scoff, he may\nremain to pray.\n\n William D. Silkworth, M.D.\n\n\n Chapter 1\n\nBILL’S STORY\n\nW\nW\nAR FEVER ran high in the New England town to\n\nwhich we new, young officers from Plattsburg were\n\nassigned, and we were flattered when the first citizens\n\ntook us to their homes, making us feel heroic. Here was\n\nlove, applause, war; moments sublime with intervals hi\n\n\nlarious. I was part of life at last, and in the midst of the\n\nexcitement I discovered liquor. I forgot the strong warn\n\n\nings and the prejudices of my people concerning drink.\n\nIn time we sailed for “Over There.” I was very lonely\n\nand again turned to alcohol.\n\nWe landed in England. I visited Winchester Cathedral.\n\nMuch moved, I wandered outside. My attention was\n\ncaught by a doggerel on an old tombstone:\n\n “Here lies a Hampshire Grenadier\n\n Who caught his death\n\n Drinking cold small beer.\n\n A good soldier is ne’er forgot\n\n Whether he dieth by musket\n\n Or by pot.”\n\nOminous warning—which I failed to heed.\n\nTwenty-two, and a veteran of foreign wars, I went home\n\nat last. I fancied myself a leader, for had not the men of\n\nmy battery given me a special token of appreciation?\n\nMy talent for leadership, I imagined, would place me at\n\nthe head of vast enterprises which I would manage with\n\nthe utmost assurance.\n\n\nI took a night law course, and obtained employment as\ninvestigator for a surety company. The drive for success\nwas on. I’d prove to the world I was important. My\nwork took me about Wall Street and little by little I became\ninterested in the market. Many people lost money—\nbut some became very rich. Why not I? I studied economics\nand business as well as law. Potential alcoholic\nthat I was, I nearly failed my law course. At one of the\nfinals I was too drunk to think or write. Though my\ndrinking was not yet continuous, it disturbed my wife.\nWe had long talks when I would still her forebodings by\ntelling her that men of genius conceived their best projects\nwhen drunk; that the most majestic constructions of philosophic\nthought were so derived.\n\nBy the time I had completed the course, I knew the law\nwas not for me. The inviting maelstrom of Wall Street\nhad me in its grip. Business and financial leaders were\nmy heroes. Out of this alloy of drink and speculation, I\ncommenced to forge the weapon that one day would turn\nin its flight like a boomerang and all but cut me to ribbons.\nLiving modestly, my wife and I saved $1,000. It went\ninto certain securities, then cheap and rather unpopular. I\nrightly imagined that they would some day have a great\nrise. I failed to persuade my broker friends to send me\nout looking over factories and managements, but my wife\nand I decided to go anyway. I had developed a theory\nthat most people lost money in stocks through ignorance\nof markets. I discovered many more reasons later on.\n\nWe gave up our positions and off we roared on a\nmotorcycle, the sidecar stuffed with tent, blankets, a\nchange of clothes, and three huge volumes of a finan\n\n\n\ncial reference service. Our friends thought a lunacy commission\nshould be appointed. Perhaps they were right. I\nhad had some success at speculation, so we had a little\nmoney, but we once worked on a farm for a month to\navoid drawing on our small capital. That was the last\nhonest manual labor on my part for many a day. We\ncovered the whole eastern United States in a year. At the\nend of it, my reports to Wall Street procured me a position\nthere and the use of a large expense account. The\nexercise of an option brought in more money, leaving us\nwith a profit of several thousand dollars for that year.\n\nFor the next few years fortune threw money and applause\nmy way. I had arrived. My judgment and ideas were followed\nby many to the tune of paper millions. The great\nboom of the late twenties was seething and swelling. Drink\nwas taking an important and exhilarating part in my life.\nThere was loud talk in the jazz places uptown. Everyone\nspent in thousands and chattered in millions. Scoffers could\nscoff and be damned. I made a host of fair-weather friends.\n\nMy drinking assumed more serious proportions, continuing\nall day and almost every night. The remonstrances of\nmy friends terminated in a row and I became a lone wolf.\nThere were many unhappy scenes in our sumptuous apartment.\nThere had been no real infidelity, for loyalty to my\nwife, helped at times by extreme drunkenness, kept me out\nof those scrapes.\n\nIn 1929 I contracted golf fever. We went at once to\nthe country, my wife to applaud while I started out to\novertake Walter Hagen.1 Liquor caught up with me much\nfaster than I came up behind Walter. I began to be\njittery in the morning. Golf permitted drinking\n\n\nevery day and every night. It was fun to carom around\nthe exclusive course which had inspired such awe in me\nas a lad. I acquired the impeccable coat of tan one sees\nupon the well-to-do. The local banker watched me whirl\nfat checks in and out of his till with amused skepticism.\n\nAbruptly in October 1929 hell broke loose on the New\nYork stock exchange. After one of those days of inferno,\nI wobbled from a hotel bar to a brokerage office. It was\neight o’clock—five hours after the market closed. The\nticker still clattered. I was staring at an inch of the tape\nwhich bore the inscription XYZ-32. It had been 52 that\nmorning. I was finished and so were many friends. The\npapers reported men jumping to death from the towers\nof High Finance. That disgusted me. I would not jump.\nI went back to the bar. My friends had dropped several\nmillion since ten o’clock—so what? Tomorrow was another\nday. As I drank, the old fierce determination to win\ncame back.\n\nNext morning I telephoned a friend in Montreal. He\nhad plenty of money left and thought I had better go to\nCanada. By the following spring we were living in our\naccustomed style. I felt like Napoleon returning from\nElba.2,3 No St. Helena for me!4 But drinking caught up\nwith me again and my generous friend had to let me go.\nThis time we stayed broke.\n\nWe went to live with my wife’s parents. I found a job;\nthen lost it as the result of a brawl with a taxi driver.\nMercifully, no one could guess that I was to have no real\nemployment for five years, or hardly draw a sober\nbreath. My wife began to work in a department store,\ncoming home exhausted to find me drunk.\n\n\nI became an unwelcome hanger-on at brokerage places.\n\nLiquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity.\n“Bathtub” gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to\nbe routine.5 Sometimes a small deal would net a few\nhundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the bars and\ndelicatessens. This went on endlessly, and I began to\nwaken very early in the morning shaking violently. A\ntumbler full of gin followed by half a dozen bottles of\nbeer would be required if I were to eat any breakfast.\nNevertheless, I still thought I could control the situation,\nand there were periods of sobriety which renewed my\nwife’s hope.\n\nGradually things got worse. The house was taken over\nby the mortgage holder, my mother-in-law died, my wife\nand father-in-law became ill.\n\nThen I got a promising business opportunity. Stocks\nwere at the low point of 1932, and I had somehow formed\na group to buy. I was to share generously in the profits.\nThen I went on a prodigious bender, and that chance\nvanished.\n\nI woke up. This had to be stopped. I saw I could not take\nso much as one drink. I was through forever. Before then, I\nhad written lots of sweet promises, but my wife happily\nobserved that this time I meant business. And so I did.\n\nShortly afterward I came home drunk. There had been no\nfight. Where had been my high resolve? I simply didn’t\nknow. It hadn’t even come to mind. Someone had pushed\na drink my way, and I had taken it. Was I crazy? I began to\nwonder, for such an appalling lack of perspective seemed\nnear being just that.\n\nRenewing my resolve, I tried again. Some time\n\n\npassed, and confidence began to be replaced by cock-\nsureness. I could laugh at the gin mills. Now I had what\nit takes! One day I walked into a cafe to telephone. In no\ntime I was beating on the bar asking myself how it happened.\nAs the whisky rose to my head I told myself I\nwould manage better next time, but I might as well get\ngood and drunk then. And I did.\n\nThe remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next morning\nare unforgettable. The courage to do battle was not there.\nMy brain raced uncontrollably and there was a terrible sense\nof impending calamity. I hardly dared cross the street, lest I\ncollapse and be run down by an early morning truck, for it\nwas scarcely daylight. An all night place supplied me with\na dozen glasses of ale. My writhing nerves were stilled at\nlast. A morning paper told me the market had gone to hell\nagain. Well, so had I. The market would recover, but I\nwouldn’t. That was a hard thought. Should I kill myself?\nNo—not now. Then a mental fog settled down. Gin would\nfix that. So two bottles, and—oblivion.\n\nThe mind and body are marvelous mechanisms, for\nmine endured this agony two more years. Sometimes I\nstole from my wife’s slender purse when the morning\nterror and madness were on me. Again I swayed dizzily\nbefore an open window, or the medicine cabinet\nwhere there was poison, cursing myself for a weakling.\nThere were flights from city to country and back, as\nmy wife and I sought escape. Then came the night\nwhen the physical and mental torture was so hellish I\nfeared I would burst through my window, sash and all.\nSomehow I managed to drag my mattress to a lower\nfloor, lest I suddenly leap. A doctor came with\n\n\na heavy sedative. Next day found me drinking both gin and\nsedative. This combination soon landed me on the rocks.\nPeople feared for my sanity. So did I. I could eat little or\nnothing when drinking, and I was forty pounds under weight.\n\nMy brother-in-law is a physician, and through his kindness\nand that of my mother I was placed in a nationally-\nknown hospital for the mental and physical rehabilitation\nof alcoholics. Under the so-called belladonna treatment my\nbrain cleared.6 Hydrotherapy and mild exercise helped much.\nBest of all, I met a kind doctor who explained that though\ncertainly selfish and foolish, I had been seriously ill, bodily\nand mentally.\n\nIt relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will\nis amazingly weakened when it comes to combating liquor,\nthough it often remains strong in other respects. My incredible\nbehavior in the face of a desperate desire to stop\nwas explained. Understanding myself now, I fared forth in\nhigh hope. For three for four months the goose hung high. I\nwent to town regularly and even made a little money. Surely\nthis was the answer—self-knowledge.\n\nBut it was not, for the frightful day came when I drank\nonce more. The curve of my declining moral and bodily\nhealth fell off like a ski-jump. After a time I returned to\nthe hospital. This was the finish, the curtain, it seemed to\nme. My weary and despairing wife was informed that it\nwould all end with heart failure during delirium tremens, or\nI would develop a wet brain, perhaps within a year. She\nwould soon have to give me over to the undertaker or the\nasylum.\n\nThey did not need to tell me. I knew, and almost\nwelcomed the idea. It was a devastating blow to my\n\n\npride. I, who had thought so well of myself and my\nabilities, of my capacity to surmount obstacles, was cornered\nat last. Now I was to plunge into the dark, joining\nthat endless procession of sots who had gone on before.\nI thought of my poor wife. There had been much happiness\nafter all. What would I not give to make amends.\nBut that was over now.\n\nNo words can tell of the loneliness and despair I found\nin that bitter morass of self-pity. Quicksand stretched\naround me in all directions. I had met my match. I had\nbeen overwhelmed. Alcohol was my master.\n\nTrembling, I stepped from the hospital a broken man.\nFear sobered me for a bit. Then came the insidious\ninsanity of that first drink, and on Armistice Day 1934,\nI was off again.7 Everyone became resigned to the certainty\nthat I would have to be shut up somewhere, or\nwould stumble along to a miserable end. How dark it is\nbefore the dawn! In reality that was the beginning of\nmy last debauch. I was soon to be catapulted into what\nI like to call the fourth dimension of existence. I was to\nknow happiness, peace, and usefulness, in a way of life\nthat is incredibly more wonderful as time passes.\n\nNear the end of that bleak November, I sat drinking in\nmy kitchen. With a certain satisfaction I reflected there\nwas enough gin concealed about the house to carry me\nthrough that night and the next day. My wife was at\nwork. I wondered whether I dared hide a full bottle of\ngin near the head of our bed. I would need it before\ndaylight.\n\nMy musing was interrupted by the telephone. The\ncheery voice of an old school friend asked if he might\n\n\ncome over. He was sober. It was years since I could\nremember his coming to New York in that condition. I\nwas amazed. Rumor had it that he had been committed\nfor alcoholic insanity. I wondered how he had escaped.\nOf course he would have dinner, and then I could drink\nopenly with him. Unmindful of his welfare, I thought\nonly of recapturing the spirit of other days. There was\nthat time we had chartered an airplane to complete a jag!\nHis coming was an oasis in this dreary desert of futility.\nThe very thing—an oasis! Drinkers are like that.\n\nThe door opened and he stood there, fresh-skinned and\nglowing. There was something about his eyes. He was\ninexplicably different. What had happened?\n\nI pushed a drink across the table. He refused it. Disappointed\nbut curious, I wondered what had got into the\nfellow. He wasn’t himself.\n\n“Come, what’s this all about?” I queried.\n\nHe looked straight at me. Simply, but smilingly, he\nsaid, “I’ve got religion.”\n\nI was aghast. So that was it—last summer an alcoholic\ncrackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion.\nHe had that starry-eyed look. Yes, the old boy was\non fire all right. But bless his heart, let him rant! Besides,\nmy gin would last longer than his preaching.\n\nBut he did no ranting. In a matter of fact way he told\nhow two men had appeared in court, persuading the judge\nto suspend his commitment. They had told of a simple\nreligious idea and a practical program of action. That was\ntwo months ago and the result was self-evident. It\nworked!\n\nHe had come to pass his experience along to me—if\n\n\nI cared to have it. I was shocked, but interested. Certainly\nI was interested. I had to be, for I was hopeless.\n\nHe talked for hours. Childhood memories rose before\nme. I could almost hear the sound of the preacher’s voice\nas I sat, on still Sundays, way over there on the hillside;\nthere was that proffered temperance pledge I never signed;\nmy grandfather’s good natured contempt of some church\nfolk and their doings; his insistence that the spheres really\nhad their music; but his denial of the preacher’s right to tell\nhim how he must listen; his fearlessness as he spoke of\nthese things just before he died; these recollections welled\nup from the past. They made me swallow hard.\n\nThat war-time day in old Winchester Cathedral came\nback again.\n\nI had always believed in a Power greater than myself. I\nhad often pondered these things. I was not an atheist.\nFew people really are, for that means blind faith in the\nstrange proposition that this universe originated in a cipher\nand aimlessly rushes nowhere. My intellectual heroes,\nthe chemists, the astronomers, even the evolutionists,\nsuggested vast laws and forces at work. Despite\ncontrary indications, I had little doubt that a mighty\npurpose and rhythm underlay all. How could there be so\nmuch of precise and immutable law, and no intelligence?\nI simply had to believe in a Spirit of the Universe, who\nknew neither time nor limitation. But that was as far as\nI had gone.\n\nWith ministers, and the world’s religions, I parted right\nthere. When they talked of a God personal to me, who\nwas love, superhuman strength and direction, I became\nirritated and my mind snapped shut against such a theory.\n\n\nTo Christ I conceded the certainty of a great man, not\ntoo closely followed by those who claimed Him. His\nmoral teaching—most excellent. For myself, I had\nadopted those parts which seemed convenient and not\ntoo difficult; the rest I disregarded.\n\nThe wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery\nthat religious dispute had facilitated, made me\nsick. I honestly doubted whether, on balance, the religions\nof mankind had done any good. Judging from what\nI had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in\nhuman affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a\ngrim jest. If there was a Devil, he seemed the Boss Universal,\nand he certainly had me.\n\nBut my friend sat before me, and he made the pointblank\ndeclaration that God had done for him what he\ncould not do for himself. His human will had failed.\nDoctors had pronounced him incurable. Society was about\nto lock him up. Like myself, he had admitted complete\ndefeat. Then he had, in effect, been raised from the dead,\nsuddenly taken from the scrap heap to a level of life\nbetter than the best he had ever known!\n\nHad this power originated in him? Obviously it had\nnot. There had been no more power in him than there\nwas in me at the minute; and this was none at all.\n\nThat floored me. It began to look as though religious\npeople were right after all. Here was something at work\nin a human heart which had done the impossible. My\nideas about miracles were drastically revised right then.\nNever mind the musty past; here sat a miracle directly\nacross the kitchen table. He shouted great tidings.\n\nI saw that my friend was much more than inwardly\n\n\nreorganized. He was on a different footing. His roots\ngrasped a new soil.\n\nDespite the living example of my friend there remained in\nme the vestiges of my old prejudice. The word God still\naroused a certain antipathy. When the thought was expressed\nthat there might be a God personal to me this\nfeeling was intensified. I didn’t like the idea. I could go for\nsuch conceptions as Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind\nor Spirit of Nature but I resisted the thought of a Czar of\nthe Heavens, however loving His sway might be.8 I have\nsince talked with scores of men who felt the same way.\n\nMy friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He\nsaid,“Why don’t you choose your own conception of God?”\n\nThat statement hit me hard. It melted the icy intellectual\nmountain in whose shadow I had lived and shivered\nmany years. I stood in the sunlight at last.\n\nIt was only a matter of being willing to believe in a\nPower greater than myself. Nothing more was required\nof me to make my beginning. I saw that growth could\nstart from that point. Upon a foundation of complete\nwillingness I might build what I saw in my friend. Would\nI have it? Of course I would!\n\nThus was I convinced that God is concerned with us\nhumans when we want Him enough. At long last I saw, I\nfelt, I believed. Scales of pride and prejudice fell from my\neyes. A new world came into view.\n\nThe real significance of my experience in the Cathedral\nburst upon me. For a brief moment, I had needed\nand wanted God. There had been a humble willingness\nto have Him with me—and He came. But soon the\nsense of His presence had been blotted out by\n\n\nworldly clamors, mostly those within myself. And so it\nhad been ever since. How blind I had been.\n\nAt the hospital I was separated from alcohol for the last\ntime. Treatment seemed wise, for I showed signs of\ndelirium tremens.\n\nThere I humbly offered myself to God, as I then understood\nHim, to do with me as He would. I placed myself\nunreservedly under His care and direction. I admitted for\nthe first time that of myself I was nothing; that without Him\nI was lost. I ruthlessly faced my sins and became willing to\nhave my new-found Friend take them away, root and branch.\nI have not had a drink since.\n\nMy schoolmate visited me, and I fully acquainted him\nwith my problems and deficiencies. We made a list of people\nI had hurt or toward whom I felt resentment. I expressed\nmy entire willingness to approach these individuals, admitting\nmy wrong. Never was I to be critical of them. I was to\nright all such matters to the utmost of my ability.\n\nI was to test my thinking by the new God-consciousness\nwithin. Common sense would thus become uncommon\nsense. I was to sit quietly when in doubt, asking\nonly for direction and strength to meet my problems as\nHe would have me. Never was I to pray for myself,\nexcept as my requests bore on my usefulness to others.\nThen only might I expect to receive. But that would be in\ngreat measure.\n\nMy friend promised when these things were done I\nwould enter upon a new relationship with my Creator;\nthat I would have the elements of a way of living which\nanswered all my problems. Belief in the power of God,\nplus enough willingness, honesty and humility\n\n\nto establish and maintain the new order of things, were\nthe essential requirements.\n\nSimple, but not easy; a price had to be paid. It meant\ndestruction of self-centeredness. I must turn in all things\nto the Father of Light who presides over us all.\n\nThese were revolutionary and drastic proposals, but\nthe moment I fully accepted them, the effect was electric.\nThere was a sense of victory, followed by such a peace\nand serenity as I had never known. There was utter\nconfidence. I felt lifted up, as though the great clean wind\nof a mountain top blew through and through. God comes\nto most men gradually, but His impact on me was sudden\nand profound.\n\nFor a moment I was alarmed, and called my friend, the\ndoctor, to ask if I were still sane. He listened in wonder\nas I talked.\n\nFinally he shook his head saying, “Something has happened\nto you I don’t understand. But you had better\nhang on to it. Anything is better than the way you were.”\nThe good doctor now sees many men who have such\nexperiences. He knows that they are real.\n\nWhile I lay in the hospital the thought came that there\nwere thousands of hopeless alcoholics who might be glad\nto have what had been so freely given me. Perhaps I could\nhelp some of them. They in turn might work with others.\nMy friend had emphasized the absolute necessity of\ndemonstrating these principles in all my affairs. Particularly\nwas it imperative to work with others as he\nhad worked with me. Faith without works was dead, he\nsaid. And how appallingly true for the alcoholic! For if\nan alcoholic failed to perfect and enlarge his\n\n\nspiritual life through work and self-sacrifice for others, he\ncould not survive the certain trials and low spots ahead. If\nhe did not work, he would surely drink again, and if he\ndrank, he would surely die. Then faith would be dead indeed.\nWith us it is just like that.\n\nMy wife and I abandoned ourselves with enthusiasm to the\nidea of helping other alcoholics to a solution of their problems.\nIt was fortunate, for my old business associates remained skeptical\nfor a year and a half, during which I found little work. I was\nnot too well at the time, and was plagued by waves of self-pity\nand resentment. This sometimes nearly drove me back to\ndrink, but I soon found that when all other measures failed,\nwork with another alcoholic would save the day. Many times\nI have gone to my old hospital in despair. On talking to a man\nthere, I would be amazingly lifted up and set on my feet. It is\na design for living that works in rough going.\n\nWe commenced to make many fast friends and a fellowship\nhas grown up among us of which it is a wonderful\nthing to feel a part. The joy of living we really\nhave, even under pressure and difficulty. I have seen\nhundreds of families set their feet in the path that\nreally goes somewhere; have seen the most impossible\ndomestic situations righted; feuds and bitterness of all\nsorts wiped out. I have seen men come out of asylums\nand resume a vital place in the lives of their families\nand communities. Business and professional men have\nregained their standing. There is scarcely any form of\ntrouble and misery which has not been overcome among\nus. In one western city and its environs there are one\nthousand of us and our families. We meet frequently\nso that newcomers may find the fellowship\n\n\nthey seek. At these informal gatherings one may often\nsee from 50 to 200 persons. We are growing in numbers\nand power.\n\nAn alcoholic in his cups is an unlovely creature. Our\nstruggles with them are variously strenuous, comic, and\ntragic. One poor chap committed suicide in my home.\nHe could not, or would not, see our way of life.\n\nThere is, however a vast amount of fun about it all. I\nsuppose some would be shocked at our seeming worldliness\nand levity. But just underneath there is deadly earnestness.\nFaith has to work twenty-four hours a day in\nand through us, or we perish.\n\nMost of us feel we need look no further for Utopia. We\nhave it with us right here and now. Each day my friend’s\nsimple talk in our kitchen multiplies itself in a widening\ncircle of peace on earth and good will to men.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Walter Hagen: a golf champion from 1914 to 1929.\n2 Napoleon Bonaparte: The Emperor of France 1804 to 1814.\n3 Elba: Italian island Napoleon was exiled to and escaped from in 1815.\n4 St. Helena: British island where Napoleon was imprisoned after\nhis brief reign as Emperor in 1815.

Nearly all have recovered. They have\n\nsolved the drink problem.\n\nWe are average Americans. All sections of this country\n\nand many of its occupations are represented, as well as\n\nmany political, economic, social, and religious back\n\n\ngrounds. We are people who normally would not mix.\n\nBut there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness,\n\nand an understanding which is indescribably wonderful.\n\nWe are like the passengers of a great liner the moment\n\nafter rescue from shipwreck when camaraderie, joyous\n\n\nness and democracy pervade the vessel from steerage to\n\nCaptain’s table. Unlike the feelings of the ship’s passen\n\n\ngers, however, our joy in escape from disaster does not\n\nsubside as we go our individual ways. The feeling of\n\nhaving shared in a common peril is one element in the\n\npowerful cement which binds us. But that in itself would\n\nnever have held us together as we are now joined.\n\nThe tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have\n\ndiscovered a common solution. We have a way out on\n\nwhich we can absolutely agree, and upon which we can join\n\nin brotherly and harmonious action. This is the great news\n\nthis book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism.\n\n\nAn illness of this sort—and we have come to believe it\nan illness—involves those about us in a way no other\nhuman sickness can. If a person has cancer all are sorry\nfor him and no one is angry or hurt. But not so with the\nalcoholic illness, for with it there goes annihilation of all\nthe things worth while in life. It engulfs all whose lives\ntouch the sufferer’s. It brings misunderstanding, fierce\nresentment, financial insecurity, disgusted friends and employers,\nwarped lives of blameless children, sad wives\nand parents—anyone can increase the list.\n\nWe hope this volume will inform and comfort those\nwho are, or who may be affected. There are many.\n\nHighly competent psychiatrists who have dealt with us\nhave found it sometimes impossible to persuade an alcoholic\nto discuss his situation without reserve. Strangely\nenough, wives, parents and intimate friends usually find\nus even more unapproachable than do the psychiatrist\nand the doctor.\n\nBut the ex-problem drinker who has found this solution,\nwho is properly armed with facts about himself, can generally\nwin the entire confidence of another alcoholic in a\nfew hours. Until such an understanding is reached, little\nor nothing can be accomplished.\n\nThat the man who is making the approach has had\nthe same difficulty, that he obviously knows what he\nis talking about, that his whole deportment shouts at\nthe new prospect that he is a man with a real answer,\nthat he has no attitude of Holier Than Thou, nothing\nwhatever except the sincere desire to be helpful; that\nthere are no fees to pay, no axes to grind, no people to\nplease, no lectures to be endured—these are the condi\n\n\n\ntions we have found most effective. After such an approach\nmany take up their beds and walk again.\n\nNone of us makes a sole vocation of this work, nor do we\nthink its effectiveness would be increased if we did. We feel\nthat elimination of our drinking is but a beginning. A much\nmore important demonstration of our principles lies before\nus in our respective homes, occupations and affairs. All of us\nspend much of our spare time in the sort of effort which we\nare going to describe. A few are fortunate enough to be so\nsituated that they can give nearly all their time to the work.\n\nIf we keep on the way we are going there is little doubt\nthat much good will result, but the surface of the problem\nwould hardly be scratched. Those of us who live in large\ncities are overcome by the reflection that close by hundreds\nare dropping into oblivion every day. Many could recover\nif they had the opportunity we have enjoyed. How then\nshall we present that which has been so freely given us?\n\nWe have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting\nforth the problem as we see it. We shall bring to the\ntask our combined experience and knowledge. This should\nsuggest a useful program for anyone concerned with a drinking\nproblem.\n\nOf necessity there will have to be discussion of matters\nmedical, psychiatric, social, and religious. We are\naware that these matters are, from their very nature,\ncontroversial. Nothing would please us so much as to\nwrite a book which would contain no basis for contention\nor argument. We shall do our utmost to achieve\nthat ideal. Most of us sense that real tolerance of\nother people’s shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect\nfor their opinions are attitudes which make us\n\n\nmore useful to others. Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers,\ndepend upon our constant thought of others and how we may\nhelp meet their needs.\n\nYou may already have asked yourself why it is that all of us\nbecame so very ill from drinking. Doubtless you are curious\nto discover how and why, in the face of expert opinion to the\ncontrary, we have recovered from a hopeless condition of\nmind and body. If you are an alcoholic who wants to get over\nit, you may already be asking—“What do I have to do?”\n\nIt is the purpose of this book to answer such questions\nspecifically. We shall tell you what we have done. Before\ngoing into a detailed discussion, it may be well to summarize\nsome points as we see them.\n\nHow many times people have said to us:“I can take it or\nleave it alone. Why can’t he?” “Why don’t you drink like\na gentleman or quit?” “That fellow can’t handle his liquor.”\n“Why don’t you try beer and wine?” “Lay off the hard\nstuff.” “His will power must be weak.” “He could stop if\nhe wanted to.” “She’s such a sweet girl, I should think he’d\nstop for her sake.” “The doctor told him that if he ever\ndrank again it would kill him, but there he is all lit up again.”\n\nNow these are commonplace observations on drinkers\nwhich we hear all the time. Back of them is a world of\nignorance and misunderstanding. We see that these expressions\nrefer to people whose reactions are very different\nfrom ours.\n\nModerate drinkers have little trouble in giving up liquor\nentirely if they have good reason for it. They can take it or\nleave it alone.\n\nThen we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may\nhave the habit badly enough to gradually impair\n\n\nhim physically and mentally. It may cause him to die a few\nyears before his time. If a sufficiently strong reason—ill\nhealth, falling in love, change of environment, or the warning\nof a doctor—becomes operative, this man can also stop\nor moderate, although he may find it difficult and troublesome\nand may even need medical attention.\n\nBut what about the real alcoholic? He may start off as\na moderate drinker; he may or may not become a continous\nhard drinker; but at some stage of his drinking career he\nbegins to lose all control of his liquor consumption, once\nhe starts to drink.\n\nHere is the fellow who has been puzzling you, especially\nin his lack of control. He does absurd, incredible,\ntragic things while drinking. He is a real Dr. Jekyll and\nMr. Hyde.1 He is seldom mildly intoxicated. He is always\nmore or less insanely drunk. His disposition while\ndrinking resembles his normal nature but little. He may\nbe one of the finest fellows in the world. Yet let him drink\nfor a day, and he frequently becomes disgustingly, and\neven dangerously anti-social. He has a positive genius\nfor getting tight at exactly the wrong moment, particularly\nwhen some important decision must be made or\nengagement kept. He is often perfectly sensible and well\nbalanced concerning everything except liquor, but in that\nrespect he is incredibly dishonest and selfish. He often\npossesses special abilities, skills, and aptitudes, and has\na promising career ahead of him. He uses his gifts to build\nup a bright outlook for his family and himself, and then\npulls the structure down on his head by a senseless series\nof sprees. He is the fellow who goes to bed so intoxicated\nhe ought to sleep the clock around. Yet early next\n\n\nmorning he searches madly for the bottle he misplaced the\nnight before. If he can afford it, he may have liquor concealed\nall over his house to be certain no one gets his entire\nsupply away from him to throw down the wastepipe. As\nmatters grow worse, he begins to use a combination of high-\npowered sedative and liquor to quiet his nerves so he can go\nto work. Then comes the day when he simply cannot make\nit and gets drunk all over again. Perhaps he goes to a doctor\nwho gives him morphine or some sedative with which to\ntaper off. Then he begins to appear at hospitals and sanitariums.\n\n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive picture of the true\nalcoholic, as our behavior patterns vary. But this description\nshould identify him roughly.\n\nWhy does he behave like this? If hundreds of experiences\nhave shown him that one drink means another debacle with\nall its attendant suffering and humiliation, why is it he takes\nthat one drink? Why can’t he stay on the water wagon?\nWhat has become of the common sense and will power that\nhe still sometimes displays with respect to other matters?\n\nPerhaps there never will be a full answer to these questions.\nOpinions vary considerably as to why the alcoholic\nreacts differently from normal people. We are not sure why,\nonce a certain point is reached, little can be done for him. We\ncannot answer the riddle.\n\nWe know that while the alcoholic keeps away from\ndrink, as he may do for months or years, he reacts\nmuch like other men. We are equally positive that once\nhe takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something\nhappens, both in the bodily and mental sense,\nwhich makes it virtually impossible for him to\n\n\nstop. The experience of any alcoholic will abundantly\nconfirm this.\n\nThese observations would be academic and pointless if\nour friend never took the first drink, thereby setting the\nterrible cycle in motion. Therefore, the main problem of\nthe alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body.\nIf you ask him why he started on that last bender, the\nchances are he will offer you any one of a hundred alibis.\nSometimes these excuses have a certain plausibility, but\nnone of them really makes sense in the light of the havoc\nan alcoholic’s drinking bout creates. They sound like the\nphilosophy of the man who, having a headache, beats\nhimself on the head with a hammer so that he can’t feel\nthe ache. If you draw this fallacious reasoning to the\nattention of an alcoholic, he will laugh it off, or become\nirritated and refuse to talk.\n\nOnce in a while he may tell the truth. And the truth, strange\nto say, is usually that he has no more idea why he took that\nfirst drink than you have. Some drinkers have excuses with\nwhich they are satisfied part of the time. But in their hearts\nthey really do not know why they do it. Once this malady\nhas a real hold, they are a baffled lot. There is the obsession\nthat somehow, someday, they will beat the game. But they\noften suspect they are down for the count.\n\nHow true this is, few realize. In a vague way their\nfamilies and friends sense that these drinkers are abnormal,\nbut everybody hopefully awaits the day when the\nsufferer will rouse himself from his lethargy and assert\nhis power of will.\n\nThe tragic truth is that if the man be a real alcoholic,\nthe happy day may not arrive. He has lost\n\n\ncontrol. At a certain point in the drinking of every alcoholic,\nhe passes into a state where the most powerful desire to\nstop drinking is of absolutely no avail. This tragic situation\nhas already arrived in practically every case long before it is\nsuspected.\n\nThe fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure,\nhave lost the power of choice in drink. Our so-called will\npower becomes practically nonexistent. We are unable, at\ncertain times, to bring into our consciousness with sufficient\nforce the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a\nweek or a month ago. We are without defense against the\nfirst drink.\n\nThe almost certain consequences that follow taking even a\nglass of beer do not crowd into the mind to deter us. If these\nthoughts occur, they are hazy and readily supplanted with the\nold threadbare idea that this time we shall handle ourselves like\nother people. There is a complete failure of the kind of defense\nthat keeps one from putting his hand on a hot stove.\n\nThe alcoholic may say to himself in the most casual way,\n“It won’t burn me this time, so here’s how!” Or perhaps he\ndoesn’t think at all. How often have some of us begun to\ndrink in this nonchalant way, and after the third or fourth,\npounded on the bar and said to ourselves, “For God’s sake,\nhow did I ever get started again?” Only to have that thought\nsupplanted by “Well, I’ll stop with the sixth drink.” Or\n“What’s the use anyhow?”\n\nWhen this sort of thinking is fully established in an\nindividual with alcoholic tendencies, he has probably\nplaced himself beyond human aid, and unless locked up,\nmay die or go permanently insane. These stark and ugly\nfacts have been confirmed by legions of alco\n\n\n\nholics throughout history. But for the grace of God, there\nwould have been thousands more convincing demonstrations.\nSo many want to stop but cannot.\n\nThere is a solution. Almost none of us liked the self-\nsearching, the leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings\nwhich the process requires for its successful consummation.\nBut we saw that it really worked in others,\nand we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility\nof life as we had been living it. When, therefore, we were\napproached by those in whom the problem had been solved,\nthere was nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit\nof spiritual tools laid at our feet. We have found much of\nheaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension\nof existence of which we had not even dreamed.\n\nThe great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have\nhad deep and effective spiritual experiences* which have\nrevolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our\nfellows and toward God’s universe. The central fact of our\nlives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has\nentered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed\nmiraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things\nfor us which we could never do by ourselves.\n\nIf you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe\nthere is no middle-of-the-road solution. We were\nin a position where life was becoming impossible, and\nif we had passed into the region from which there is no\nreturn through human aid, we had but two alternatives:\nOne was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the\nconsciousness of our intolerable situation as best we\ncould; and the other, to accept spiritual help. This\n*See “Spiritual Experience.”\n\n\nwe did because we honestly wanted to, and were willing\nto make the effort.\n\nA certain American business man had ability, good sense,\nand high character. For years he had floundered from one\nsanitarium to another. He had consulted the best known\nAmerican psychiatrists. Then he had gone to Europe,\nplacing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the\npsychiatrist, Dr. Jung) who prescribed for him. Though\nexperience had made him skeptical, he finished his treatment\nwith unusual confidence. His physical and mental\ncondition were unusually good. Above all, he believed he\nhad acquired such a profound knowledge of the inner\nworkings of his mind and its hidden springs that relapse\nwas unthinkable. Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short\ntime. More baffling still, he could give himself no satisfactory\nexplanation for his fall.\n\nSo he returned to this doctor, whom he admired, and\nasked him point-blank why he could not recover. He\nwished above all things to regain self-control. He seemed\nquite rational and well-balanced with respect to other\nproblems. Yet he had no control whatever over alcohol.\nWhy was this?\n\nHe begged the doctor to tell him the whole truth, and he\ngot it. In the doctor’s judgment he was utterly hopeless;\nhe could never regain his position in society and he would\nhave to place himself under lock and key or hire a bodyguard\nif he expected to live long. That was a great\nphysician’s opinion.\n\nBut this man still lives, and is a free man. He does not\nneed a bodyguard nor is he confined. He can go anywhere\non this earth where other free men may go\n\n\nwithout disaster, provided he remains willing to maintain a\ncertain simple attitude.\n\nSome of our alcoholic readers may think they can do\nwithout spiritual help. Let us tell you the rest of the\nconversation our friend had with his doctor.\n\nThe doctor said: “You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic.\nI have never seen one single case recover, where that\nstate of mind existed to the extent that it does in you.” Our\nfriend felt as though the gates of hell had closed on him\nwith a clang.\n\nHe said to the doctor, “Is there no exception?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the doctor,“ there is. Exceptions to cases\nsuch as yours have been occurring since early times. Here and\nthere, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital\nspiritual experiences. To me these occurrences are phenomena.\nThey appear to be in the nature of huge emotional\ndisplacements and rearrangements. Ideas, emotions, and attitudes\nwhich were once theguiding forces of the lives of these\nmen are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely new set\nof conceptions and motives begin to dominate them. In fact,\nI have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement\nwithin you. With many individuals the methods which\nI employed are successful, but I have never been successful\nwith an alcoholic of your description.”*\n\nUpon hearing this, our friend was somewhat relieved, for\nhe reflected that, after all, he was a good church member.\nThis hope, however, was destroyed by the doctor’s telling\nhim that while his religious convictions were very good, in\nhis case they did not spell the necessary vital spiritual\nexperience.\n*See “Spiritual Experience.”\n\n\nHere was the terrible dilemma in which our friend found\nhimself when he had the extraordinary experience, which\nas we have already told you, made him a free man.\n\nWe, in our turn, sought the same escape with all the\ndesperation of drowning men. What seemed at first a\nflimsy reed, has proved to be the loving and powerful\nhand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you\nprefer, “a design for living” that really works.\n\nThe distinguished American psychologist, William\nJames, in his book “Varieties of Religious Experience,”\nindicates a multitude of ways in which men have discovered\nGod. We have no desire to convince anyone that\nthere is only one way by which faith can be acquired. If\nwhat we have learned and felt and seen means anything at\nall, it means that all of us, whatever our race, creed, or\ncolor are the children of a living Creator with whom we\nmay form a relationship upon simple and understandable\nterms as soon as we are willing and honest enough to try.\nThose having religious affiliations will find here nothing\ndisturbing to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no\nfriction among us over such matters.\n\nWe think it no concern of ours what religious bodies our\nmembers identify themselves with as individuals. This\nshould be an entirely personal affair which each one decides\nfor himself in the light of past associations, or his\npresent choice. Not all of us join religious bodies, but\nmost of us favor such memberships.\n\nIn the following chapter, there appears an explanation\nof alcoholism, as we understand it, then a chapter\naddressed to the agnostic. Many who once were in\nthis class are now among our members. Surprisingly\n\n\nenough, we find such convictions no great obstacle to a\nspiritual experience.\n\nFurther on, clear-cut directions are given showing how\nwe recovered. These are followed by forty-three personal\nexperiences.\n\nEach individual, in the personal stories, describes in his\nown language and from his own point of view the way he\nestablished his relationship with God. These give a fair\ncross section of our membership and a clear-cut idea of\nwhat has actually happened in their lives.\n\nWe hope no one will consider these self-revealing accounts\nin bad taste. Our hope is that many alcoholic men\nand women, desperately in need, will see these pages,\nand we believe that it is only by fully disclosing ourselves\nand our problems that they will be persuaded to\nsay, “Yes, I am one of them too; I must have this thing.”\n\nNotes\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: literary reference to describe a personwith a split personality - one good and the other bad.\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMORE ABOUT ALCOHOLISM\n\nM\nM\nOST OF us have been unwilling to admit we were\nreal alcoholics. No person likes to think he is bodily\nand mentally different from his fellows. Therefore, it is\nnot surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized\nby countless vain attempts to prove we could\ndrink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday\nhe will control and enjoy his drinking is the great\nobsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of\nthis illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates\nof insanity or death.\nWe learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost\nselves that we were alcoholics. This is the first\nstep in recovery. The delusion that we are like other\npeople, or presently may be, has to be smashed.\nWe alcoholics are men and women who have lost the\nability to control our drinking. We know that no real\nalcoholic ever recovers control. All of us felt at times\nthat we were regaining control, but such intervals—usually\nbrief—were inevitably followed by still less control,\nwhich led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization.\nWe are convinced to a man that alcoholics of\nour type are in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any\nconsiderable period we get worse, never better.\nWe are like men who have lost their legs; they never\ngrow new ones. Neither does there appear to be any\nkind of treatment which will make alcoholics of\n\n\nour kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable\nremedy. In some instances there has been brief recovery,\nfollowed always by a still worse relapse. Physicians\nwho are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such\nthing as making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic. Science\nmay one day accomplish this, but it hasn’t done so\nyet.\n\nDespite all we can say, many who are real alcoholics are\nnot going to believe they are in that class. By every form\nof self-deception and experimentation, they will try to\nprove themselves exceptions to the rule, therefore nonalcoholic.\nIf anyone who is showing inability to control his\ndrinking can do the right- about-face and drink like a gentleman,\nour hats are off to him. Heaven knows, we have tried\nhard enough and long enough to drink like other people!\n\nHere are some of the methods we have tried: Drinking\nbeer only, limiting the number of drinks, never drinking\nalone, never drinking in the morning, drinking only at\nhome, never having it in the house, never drinking during\nbusiness hours, drinking only at parties, switching from\nscotch to brandy, drinking only natural wines, agreeing to\nresign if ever drunk on the job, taking a trip, not taking a\ntrip, swearing off forever (with and without a solemn\noath), taking more physical exercise, reading inspirational\nbooks, going to health farms and sanitariums, accepting\nvoluntary commitment to asylums—we could increase\nthe list ad infinitum.\n\nWe do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic,\nbut you can quickly diagnose yourself. Step\nover to the nearest barroom and try some controlled\ndrinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it\n\n\nmore than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if\nyou are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth a\nbad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your\ncondition.\n\nThough there is no way of proving it, we believe that\nearly in our drinking careers most of us could have stopped\ndrinking. But the difficulty is that few alcoholics have\nenough desire to stop while there is yet time. We have\nheard of a few instances where people, who showed definite\nsigns of alcoholism, were able to stop for a long\nperiod because of an overpowering desire to do so. Here\nis one.\n\nA man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking.\nHe was very nervous in the morning after these bouts\nand quieted himself with more liquor. He was ambitious\nto succeed in business, but saw that he would get nowhere\nif he drank at all. Once he started, he had no\ncontrol whatever. He made up his mind that until he had\nbeen successful in business and had retired, he would not\ntouch another drop. An exceptional man, he remained\nbone dry for twenty-five years and retired at the age of\nfifty-five, after a successful and happy business career.\nThen he fell victim to a belief which practically every\nalcoholic has—that his long period of sobriety and self-\ndiscipline had qualified him to drink as other men. Out\ncame his carpet slippers and a bottle. In two months he\nwas in a hospital, puzzled and humiliated. He tried to\nregulate his drinking for a while, making several trips to\nthe hospital meantime. Then, gathering all his forces, he\nattempted to stop altogether and found he could not.\nEvery means of solving his problem which\n\n\nmoney could buy was at his disposal. Every attempt\nfailed. Though a robust man at retirement, he went to\npieces quickly and was dead within four years.\n\nThis case contains a powerful lesson. Most of us have\nbelieved that if we remained sober for a long stretch, we\ncould thereafter drink normally. But here is a man who at\nfifty-five years found he was just where he had left off at\nthirty. We have seen the truth demonstrated again and\nagain: “Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.” Commencing\nto drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a\nshort time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop\ndrinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any\nlurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.\n\nYoung people may be encouraged by this man’s experience\nto think that they can stop, as he did, on their own\nwill power. We doubt if many of them can do it, because\nnone will really want to stop, and hardly one of them,\nbecause of the peculiar mental twist already acquired,\nwill find he can win out. Several of our crowd, men of\nthirty or less, had been drinking only a few years, but\nthey found themselves as helpless as those who had been\ndrinking twenty years.\n\nTo be gravely affected, one does not necessarily\nhave to drink a long time nor take the quantities\nsome of us have. This is particularly true of women.\nPotential female alcoholics often turn into the real\nthing and are gone beyond recall in a few years.\nCertain drinkers, who would be greatly insulted if\ncalled alcoholics, are astonished at their inability to\nstop. We, who are familiar with the symptoms, see\nlarge numbers of potential alcoholics among young\n\n\npeople everywhere. But try and get them to see it!*\n\nAs we look back, we feel we had gone on drinking many\nyears beyond the point where we could quit on our will\npower. If anyone questions whether he has entered this\ndangerous area, let him try leaving liquor alone for one\nyear. If he is a real alcoholic and very far advanced, there\nis scant chance of success. In the early days of our drinking\nwe occasionally remained sober for a year or more,\nbecoming serious drinkers again later. Though you may\nbe able to stop for a considerable period, you may yet be\na potential alcoholic. We think few, to whom this book\nwill appeal, can stay dry anything like a year. Some will\nbe drunk the day after making their resolutions; most of\nthem within a few weeks.\n\nFor those who are unable to drink moderately the question\nis how to stop altogether. We are assuming, of\ncourse, that the reader desires to stop. Whether such a\nperson can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon\nthe extent to which he has already lost the power to\nchoose whether he will drink or not. Many of us felt\nthat we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous\nurge to cease forever. Yet we found it impossible.\nThis is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know\nit—this utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how\ngreat the necessity or the wish.\n\nHow then shall we help our readers determine, to\ntheir own satisfaction, whether they are one of us?\nThe experiment of quitting for a period of time will be\nhelpful, but we think we can render an even greater\nservice to alcoholic sufferers and perhaps to the med\n\n\n*True when this book was first published. In 1993 a membership\nsurvey showed that one-fifth of AAs were 30 and under.\n\n\nical fraternity. So we shall describe some of the mental\nstates that precede a relapse into drinking, for obviously\nthis is the crux of the problem.\n\nWhat sort of thinking dominates an alcoholic who repeats\ntime after time the desperate experiment of the\nfirst drink? Friends who have reasoned with him after a\nspree which has brought him to the point of divorce or\nbankruptcy are mystified when he walks directly into a\nsaloon. Why does he? Of what is he thinking?\n\nOur first example is a friend we shall call Jim. This\nman has a charming wife and family. He inherited a\nlucrative automobile agency. He had a commendable\nWorld War record. He is a good salesman. Everybody\nlikes him. He is an intelligent man, normal so far as we\ncan see, except for a nervous disposition. He did no\ndrinking until he was thirty-five. In a few years he\nbecame so violent when intoxicated that he had to be\ncommitted. On leaving the asylum he came into contact\nwith us.\n\nWe told him what we knew of alcoholism and the answer\nwe had found. He made a beginning. His family\nwas re-assembled, and he began to work as a salesman\nfor the business he had lost through drinking. All went\nwell for a time, but he failed to enlarge his spiritual life.\nTo his consternation, he found himself drunk half a dozen\ntimes in rapid succession. On each of these occasions\nwe worked with him, reviewing carefully what had happened.\nHe agreed he was a real alcoholic and in a serious\ncondition. He knew he faced another trip to the asylum\nif he kept on. Moreover, he would lose his family for\nwhom he had a deep affection.\n\n\nYet he got drunk again. We asked him to tell us exactly\nhow it happened. This is his story: “I came to work on\nTuesday morning. I remember I felt irritated that I had to\nbe a salesman for a concern I once owned. I had a few\nwords with the boss, but nothing serious. Then I decided\nto drive into the country and see one of my prospects for\na car. On the way I felt hungry so I stopped at a roadside\nplace where they have a bar. I had no intention of drinking.\nI just thought I would get a sandwich. I also had the\nnotion that I might find a customer for a car at this place,\nwhich was familiar for I had been going to it for years. I\nhad eaten there many times during the months I was\nsober. I sat down at a table and ordered a sandwich and a\nglass of milk. Still no thought of drinking. I ordered\nanother sandwich and decided to have another glass of\nmilk.\n\n“Suddenly the thought crossed my mind that if I were\nto put an ounce of whiskey in my milk it couldn’t hurt\nme on a full stomach. I ordered a whiskey and poured\nit into the milk. I vaguely sensed I was not being any\ntoo smart, but felt reassured as I was taking the whiskey\non a full stomach. The experiment went so well\nthat I ordered another whiskey and poured it into more\nmilk. That didn’t seem to bother me so I tried another.”\n\n\nThus started one more journey to the asylum for\nJim. Here was the threat of commitment, the loss of\nfamily and position, to say nothing of that intense\nmental and physical suffering which drinking always\ncaused him. He had much knowledge about himself as\nan alcoholic. Yet all reasons for not drinking were\n\n\neasily pushed aside in favor of the foolish idea that he\ncould take whiskey if only he mixed it with milk!\n\nWhatever the precise definition of the word may be, we\ncall this plain insanity. How can such a lack of proportion,\nof the ability to think straight, be called anything\nelse?\n\nYou may think this an extreme case. To us it is not far-\nfetched, for this kind of thinking has been characteristic\nof every single one of us. We have sometimes reflected\nmore than Jim did upon the consequences. But there was\nalways the curious mental phenomenon that parallel with\nour sound reasoning there inevitably ran some insanely\ntrivial excuse for taking the first drink. Our sound reasoning\nfailed to hold us in check. The insane idea won\nout. Next day we would ask ourselves, in all earnestness\nand sincerity, how it could have happened.\n\nIn some circumstances we have gone out deliberately to\nget drunk, feeling ourselves justified by nervousness, anger,\nworry, depression, jealousy or the like. But even in\nthis type of beginning we are obliged to admit that our\njustification for a spree was insanely insufficient in the\nlight of what always happened. We now see that when we\nbegan to drink deliberately, instead of casually, there was\nlittle serious or effective thought during the period of premeditation\nof what the terrific consequences might be.\n\nOur behavior is as absurd and incomprehensible with\nrespect to the first drink as that of an individual with a\npassion, say, for jay-walking. He gets a thrill out of\nskipping in front of fast-moving vehicles. He enjoys\nhimself for a few years in spite of friendly warnings.\nUp to this point you would label him as a foolish\n\n\nchap having queer ideas of fun. Luck then deserts him\nand he is slightly injured several times in succession. You\nwould expect him, if he were normal, to cut it out. Presently\nhe is hit again and this time has a fractured skull.\nWithin a week after leaving the hospital a fast-moving\ntrolley car breaks his arm. He tells you he has decided to\nstop jay-walking for good, but in a few weeks he breaks\nboth legs.\n\nOn through the years this conduct continues, accompanied\nby his continual promises to be careful or to keep\noff the streets altogether. Finally, he can no longer work,\nhis wife gets a divorce and he is held up to ridicule. He\ntries every known means to get the jay-walking idea out\nof his head. He shuts himself up in an asylum, hoping to\nmend his ways. But the day he comes out he races in\nfront of a fire engine, which breaks his back. Such a man\nwould be crazy, wouldn’t he?\n\nYou may think our illustration is too ridiculous. But is\nit? We, who have been through the wringer, have to\nadmit if we substituted alcoholism for jay-walking, the\nillustration would fit us exactly. However intelligent we\nmay have been in other respects, where alcohol has been\ninvolved, we have been strangely insane. It’s strong language—\nbut isn’t it true?\n\nSome of you are thinking: “Yes, what you tell us is\ntrue, but it doesn’t fully apply. We admit we have\nsome of these symptoms, but we have not gone to the\nextremes you fellows did, nor are we likely to, for we\nunderstand ourselves so well after what you have told\nus that such things cannot happen again. We have not\nlost everything in life through drinking and we\n\n\ncertainly do not intend to. Thanks for the information.”\n\n\nThat may be true of certain nonalcoholic people who,\nthough drinking foolishly and heavily at the present\ntime, are able to stop or moderate, because their brains\nand bodies have not been damaged as ours were. But\nthe actual or potential alcoholic, with hardly an exception,\nwill beabsolutely unable to stop drinking on the\nbasis of self-knowledge. This is a point we wish to\nemphasize and re-emphasize, to smash home upon our\nalcoholic readers as it has been revealed to us out of\nbitter experience. Let us take another illustration.\n\nFred is partner in a well known accounting firm. His\nincome is good, he has a fine home, is happily married\nand the father of promising children of college age. He\nhas so attractive a personality that he makes friends\nwith everyone. If ever there was a successful business\nman, it is Fred. To all appearance he is a stable, well\nbalanced individual. Yet, he is alcoholic. We first saw\nFred about a year ago in a hospital where he had gone to\nrecover from a bad case of jitters. It was his first experience\nof this kind, and he was much ashamed of it. Far\nfrom admitting he was an alcoholic, he told himself he\ncame to the hospital to rest his nerves. The doctor\nintimated strongly that he might be worse than he realized.\nFor a few days he was depressed about his condition.\nHe made up his mind to quit drinking altogether.\nIt never occurred to him that perhaps he could not do\nso, in spite of his character and standing. Fred would\nnot believe himself an alcoholic, much less accept a\nspiritual remedy for his problem. We told him what\n\n\nwe knew about alcoholism. He was interested and conceded\nthat he had some of the symptoms, but he was a\nlong way from admitting that he could do nothing about\nit himself. He was positive that this humiliating experience,\nplus the knowledge he had acquired, would keep\nhim sober the rest of his life. Self-knowledge would fix it.\n\nWe heard no more of Fred for a while. One day we were\ntold that he was back in the hospital. This time he was\nquite shaky. He soon indicated he was anxious to see us.\nThe story he told is most instructive, for here was a chap\nabsolutely convinced he had to stop drinking, who had\nno excuse for drinking, who exhibited splendid judgment\nand determination in all his other concerns, yet was flat\non his back nevertheless.\n\nLet him tell you about it: “I was much impressed with\nwhat you fellows said about alcoholism, and I frankly\ndid not believe it would be possible for me to drink again.\nI rather appreciated your ideas about the subtle insanity\nwhich precedes the first drink, but I was confident it\ncould not happen to me after what I had learned. I reasoned\nI was not so far advanced as most of you fellows,\nthat I had been usually successful in licking my other\npersonal problems, and that I would therefore be successful\nwhere you men failed. I felt I had every right to be\nself-confident, that it would be only a matter of exercising\nmy will power and keeping on guard.\n\n“In this frame of mind, I went about my business\nand for a time all was well. I had no trouble refusing\ndrinks, and began to wonder if I had not been making\ntoo hard work of a simple matter. One day I went to\nWashington to present some accounting evidence to\n\n\na government bureau. I had been out of town before\nduring this particular dry spell, so there was nothing new\nabout that. Physically, I felt fine. Neither did I have any\npressing problems or worries. My business came off\nwell, I was pleased and knew my partners would be too.\nIt was the end of a perfect day, not a cloud on the horizon.\n\n\n“I went to my hotel and leisurely dressed for dinner. As\nI crossed the threshold of the dining room, the thought\ncame to mind that it would be nice to have a couple of\ncocktails with dinner. That was all. Nothing more. I\nordered a cocktail and my meal. Then I ordered another\ncocktail. After dinner I decided to take a walk. When I\nreturned to the hotel it struck me a highball would be fine\nbefore going to bed, so I stepped into the bar and had one.\nI remember having several more that night and plenty\nnext morning. I have a shadowy recollection of being in\nan airplane bound for New York and of finding a friendly\ntaxicab driver at the landing field instead of my wife. The\ndriver escorted me about for several days. I know little\nof where I went or what I said and did. Then came the\nhospital with unbearable mental and physical suffering.\n“As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went\ncarefully over that evening in Washington. Not only\nhad I been off guard, I had made no fight whatever\nagainst the first drink. This time I had not thought of\nthe consequences at all. I had commenced to drink as\ncarelessly as though the cocktails were ginger ale. I\nnow remembered what my alcoholic friends had told\nme, how they prophesied that if I had an alcoholic\nmind, the time and place would come—I would drink\n\n\nagain. They had said that though I did raise a defense, it\nwould one day give way before some trivial reason for\nhaving a drink. Well, just that did happen and more, for\nwhat I had learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all.\nI knew from that moment that I had an alcoholic mind. I\nsaw that will power and self-knowledge would not help in\nthose strange mental blank spots. I had never been able to\nunderstand people who said that a problem had them hopelessly\ndefeated. I knew then. It was a crushing blow.\n\n“Two of the members of Alcoholics Anonymous came\nto see me. They grinned, which I didn’t like so much, and\nthen asked me if I thought myself alcoholic and if I were\nreally licked this time. I had to concede both propositions.\nThey piled on me heaps of evidence to the effect\nthat an alcoholic mentality, such as I had exhibited in\nWashington, was a hopeless condition. They cited cases\nout of their own experience by the dozen. This process\nsnuffed out the last flicker of conviction that I could do\nthe job myself.\n\n“Then they outlined the spiritual answer and program\nof action which a hundred of them had followed successfully.\nThough I had been only a nominal churchman, their\nproposals were not, intellectually, hard to swallow. But\nthe program of action, though entirely sensible, was pretty\ndrastic. It meant I would have to throw several lifelong\nconceptions out of the window. That was not easy. But\nthe moment I made up my mind to go through with the\nprocess, I had the curious feeling that my alcoholic condition\nwas relieved, as in fact it proved to be.\n\n“Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual\nprinciples would solve all my problems. I have since\n\n\nbeen brought into a way of living infinitely more satisfying\nand, I hope, more useful than the life I lived before.\nMy old manner of life was by no means a bad one, but I\nwould not exchange its best moments for the worst I\nhave now. I would not go back to it even if I could.”\n\nFred’s story speaks for itself. We hope it strikes home\nto thousands like him. He had felt only the first nip of\nthe wringer. Most alcoholics have to be pretty badly\nmangled before they really commence to solve their problems.\n\n\nMany doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions.\nOne of these men, staff member of a world-renowned\nhospital, recently made this statement to some\nof us: “What you say about the general hopelessness of\nthe average alcoholic’s plight is, in my opinion, correct.\nAs to two of you men, whose stories I have heard, there\nis no doubt in my mind that you were 100% hopeless,\napart from divine help. Had you offered yourselves as\npatients at this hospital, I would not have taken you, if I\nhad been able to avoid it. People like you are too heartbreaking.\nThough not a religious person, I have profound\nrespect for the spiritual approach in such cases as yours.\nFor most cases, there is virtually no other solution.”\n\nOnce more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective\nmental defense against the first drink. Except in a\nfew rare cases, neither he nor any other human being can\nprovide such a defense. His defense must come from a\nHigher Power.\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nWE AGNOSTICS\n\nI\nI\nN THE PRECEDING chapters you have learned something\nof alcoholism. We hope we have made clear the\ndistinction between the alcoholic and the nonalcoholic.\nIf, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit\nentirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over\nthe amount you take, you are probably alcoholic. If that\nbe the case, you may be suffering from an illness which\nonly a spiritual experience will conquer.\nTo one who feels he is an atheist or agnostic such an\nexperience seems impossible, but to continue as he is\nmeans disaster, especially if he is an alcoholic of the\nhopeless variety. To be doomed to an alcoholic death or\nto live on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives\nto face.\nBut it isn’t so difficult. About half our original fellowship\nwere of exactly that type. At first some of us tried\nto avoid the issue, hoping against hope we were not true\nalcoholics. But after a while we had to face the fact that\nwe must find a spiritual basis of life—or else. Perhaps it\nis going to be that way with you. But cheer up, something\nlike half of us thought we were atheists or agnostics.\nOur experience shows that you need not be disconcerted.\nIf a mere code of morals or a better philosophy of life\nwere sufficient to overcome alcoholism, many of us\n\n\nwould have recovered long ago. But we found that such\ncodes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how\nmuch we tried. We could wish to be moral, we could\nwish to be philosophically comforted, in fact, we could\nwill these things with all our might, but the needed power\nwasn’t there. Our human resources, as marshalled by the\nwill, were not sufficient; they failed utterly.\n\nLack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a\npower by which we could live, and it had to be aPower\ngreater than ourselves. Obviously. But where and how\nwere we to find this Power?\n\nWell, that’s exactly what this book is about. Its main\nobject is to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself\nwhich will solve your problem. That means we have\nwritten a book which we believe to be spiritual as well as\nmoral. And it means, of course, that we are going to talk\nabout God. Here difficulty arises with agnostics. Many\ntimes we talk to a new man and watch his hope rise as we\ndiscuss his alcoholic problems and explain our fellowship.\nBut his face falls when we speak of spiritual matters,\nespecially when we mention God, for we have reopened\na subject which our man thought he had neatly\nevaded or entirely ignored.\n\nWe know how he feels. We have shared his honest\ndoubt and prejudice. Some of us have been violently\nanti-religious. To others, the word “God” brought up\na particular idea of Him with which someone had tried\nto impress them during childhood. Perhaps we rejected\nthis particular conception because it seemed inadequate.\nWith that rejection we imagined we had\nabandoned the God idea entirely. We were bothered\n\n\nwith the thought that faith and dependence upon a Power\nbeyond ourselves was somewhat weak, even cowardly.\nWe looked upon this world of warring individuals, warring\ntheological systems, and inexplicable calamity, with\ndeep skepticism. We looked askance at many individuals\nwho claimed to be godly. How could a Supreme\nBeing have anything to do with it all? And who could\ncomprehend a Supreme Being anyhow? Yet, in other\nmoments, we found ourselves thinking, when enchanted\nby a starlit night, “Who, then, made all this?” There\nwas a feeling of awe and wonder, but it was fleeting and\nsoon lost.\n\nYes, we of agnostic temperament have had these thoughts\nand experiences. Let us make haste to reassure you. We\nfound that as soon as we were able to lay aside prejudice\nand express even a willingness to believe in a Power\ngreater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even\nthough it was impossible for any of us to fully define or\ncomprehend that Power, which is God.\n\nMuch to our relief, we discovered we did not need to\nconsider another’s conception of God. Our own conception,\nhowever inadequate, was sufficient to make the approach\nand to effect a contact with Him. As soon as we\nadmitted the possible existence of a Creative Intelligence,\na Spirit of the Universe underlying the totality of things,\nwe began to be possessed of a new sense of power and\ndirection, provided we took other simple steps. We found\nthat God does not make too hard terms with those who\nseek Him. To us, the Realm of Spirit is broad, roomy, all\ninclusive; never exclusive or forbidding to those who earnestly\nseek. It is open, we believe, to all men.\n\n\nWhen, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean\nyour own conception of God. This applies, too, to other\nspiritual expressions which you find in this book. Do\nnot let any prejudice you may have against spiritual terms\ndeter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean\nto you. At the start, this was all we needed to commence\nspiritual growth, to effect our first conscious relation\nwith God as we understood Him. Afterward, we found\nourselves accepting many things which then seemed entirely\nout of reach. That was growth, but if we wished to\ngrow we had to begin somewhere. So we used our own\nconception, however limited it was.\n\nWe needed to ask ourselves but one short question.\n“Do I now believe, or am I even willing to believe, that\nthere is a Power greater than myself ?” As soon as a man\ncan say that he does believe, or is willing to believe, we\nemphatically assure him that he is on his way. It has\nbeen repeatedly proven among us that upon this simple\ncornerstone a wonderfully effective spiritual structure\ncan be built.*\n\nThat was great news to us, for we had assumed we could\nnot make use of spiritual principles unless we accepted\nmany things on faith which seemed difficult to believe.\nWhen people presented us with spiritual approaches, how\nfrequently did we all say, “I wish I had what that man has.\nI’m sure it would work if I could only believe as he believes.\nBut I cannot accept as surely true the many articles\nof faith which are so plain to him.” So it was comforting to\nlearn that we could commence at a simpler level.\n\nBesides a seeming inability to accept much on faith,\n\n*Please be sure to read “Spiritual Experience.”\n\n\nwe often found ourselves handicapped by obstinacy, sensitiveness,\nand unreasoning prejudice. Many of us have\nbeen so touchy that even casual reference to spiritual things\nmade us bristle with antagonism. This sort of thinking had\nto be abandoned. Though some of us resisted, we found\nno great difficulty in casting aside such feelings. Faced\nwith alcoholic destruction, we soon became as open minded\non spiritual matters as we had tried to be on other questions.\nIn this respect alcohol was a great persuader. It\nfinally beat us into a state of reasonableness. Sometimes\nthis was a tedious process; we hope no one else will be\nprejudiced for as long as some of us were.\n\nThe reader may still ask why he should believe in a\nPower greater than himself. We think there are good\nreasons. Let us have a look at some of them.\n\nThe practical individual of today is a stickler for facts\nand results. Nevertheless, the twentieth century readily\naccepts theories of all kinds, provided they are firmly\ngrounded in fact. We have numerous theories, for example,\nabout electricity. Everybody believes them without\na murmur of doubt. Why this ready acceptance?\nSimply because it is impossible to explain what we see,\nfeel, direct, and use, without a reasonable assumption as\na starting point.\n\nEverybody nowadays, believes in scores of assumptions\nfor which there is good evidence, but no perfect visual proof.\nAnd does not science demonstrate that visual proof is the\nweakest proof? It is being constantly revealed, as mankind\nstudies the material world, that outward appearances are\nnot inward reality at all. To illustrate:\n\nThe prosaic steel girder is a mass of electrons whirl\n\n\n\ning around each other at incredible speed. These tiny\nbodies are governed by precise laws, and these laws\nhold true throughout the material world. Science tells\nus so. We have no reason to doubt it. When, however,\nthe perfectly logical assumption is suggested that underneath\nthe material world and life as we see it, there is\nan All Powerful, Guiding, Creative Intelligence, right\nthere our perverse streak comes to the surface and we\nlaboriously set out to convince ourselves it isn’t so. We\nread wordy books and indulge in windy arguments, thinking\nwe believe this universe needs no God to explain it.\nWere our contentions true, it would follow that life originated\nout of nothing, means nothing, and proceeds nowhere.\n\n\nInstead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads\nof God’s ever advancing Creation, we agnostics\nand atheists chose to believe that our human intelligence\nwas the last word, the alpha and the omega, the beginning\nand end of all. Rather vain of us, wasn’t it?\n\nWe, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to\nlay aside prejudice, even against organized religion. We\nhave learned that whatever the human frailties of various\nfaiths may be, those faiths have given purpose and\ndirection to millions. People of faith have a logical idea\nof what life is all about. Actually, we used to have no\nreasonable conception whatever. We used to amuse ourselves\nby cynically dissecting spiritual beliefs and practices\nwhen we might have observed that many spiritually-\nminded persons of all races, colors, and creeds were\ndemonstrating a degree of stability, happiness and usefulness\nwhich we should have sought ourselves.\n\n\nInstead, we looked at the human defects of these people,\nand sometimes used their shortcomings as a basis of wholesale\ncondemnation. We talked of intolerance, while we\nwere intolerant ourselves. We missed the reality and the\nbeauty of the forest because we were diverted by the\nugliness of some of its trees. We never gave the spiritual\nside of life a fair hearing.\n\nIn our personal stories you will find a wide variation in the\nway each teller approaches and conceives of the Power\nwhich is greater than himself. Whether we agree with a\nparticular approach or conception seems to make little difference.\nExperience has taught us that these are matters\nabout which, for our purpose, we need not be worried.\nThey are questions for each individual to settle for himself.\n\nOn one proposition, however, these men and women\nare strikingly agreed. Every one of them has gained access\nto, and believes in, a Power greater than himself.\nThis Power has in each case accomplished the miraculous,\nthe humanly impossible. As a celebrated American\nstatesman put it, “Let’s look at the record.”\n\nHere are thousands of men and women, worldly\nindeed. They flatly declare that since they have\ncome to believe in a Power greater than themselves,\nto take a certain attitude toward that Power, and to\ndo certain simple things, there has been a revolutionary\nchange in their way of living and thinking. In the\nface of collapse and despair, in the face of the total\nfailure of their human resources, they found that a new\npower, peace, happiness, and sense of direction flowed\ninto them. This happened soon after they wholeheartedly\nmet a few simple requirements. Once con\n\n\n\nfused and baffled by the seeming futility of existence, they\nshow the underlying reasons why they were making heavy\ngoing of life. Leaving aside the drink question, they tell\nwhy living was so unsatisfactory. They show how the\nchange came over them. When many hundreds of people\nare able to say that the consciousness of the Presence of\nGod is today the most important fact of their lives, they\npresent a powerful reason why one should have faith.\n\nThis world of ours has made more material progress in\nthe last century than in all the millenniums which went\nbefore. Almost everyone knows the reason. Students of\nancient history tell us that the intellect of men in those\ndays was equal to the best of today. Yet in ancient times\nmaterial progress was painfully slow. The spirit of modern\nscientific inquiry, research and invention was almost\nunknown. In the realm of the material, men’s minds were\nfettered by superstition, tradition, and all sorts of fixed\nideas. Some of the contemporaries of Columbus thought\na round earth preposterous.1 Others came near putting\nGalileo to death for his astronomical heresies.2\n\nWe asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just as\nbiased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit\nas were the ancients about the realm of the material?\nEven in the present century, American newspapers\nwere afraid to print an account of the Wright brothers’\nfirst successful flight at Kitty Hawk.3 Had not all\nefforts at flight failed before? Did not Professor\nLangley’s flying machine go to the bottom of the\nPotomac River? Was it not true that the best mathematical\nminds had proved man could never fly? Had\nnot people said God had reserved this privilege to the\n\n\nbirds? Only thirty years later the conquest of the air was\nalmost an old story and airplane travel was in full swing.\n\nBut in most fields our generation has witnessed complete\nliberation of our thinking. Show any longshoreman\na Sunday supplement describing a proposal to explore\nthe moon by means of a rocket and he will say “I bet they\ndo it — maybe not so long either.” Is not our age characterized\nby the ease with which we discard old ideas for\nnew, by the complete readiness with which we throw\naway the theory or gadget which does not work for something\nnew which does?\n\nWe had to ask ourselves why we shouldn’t apply to our\nhuman problems this same readiness to change our point\nof view. We were having trouble with personal relationships,\nwe couldn’t control our emotional natures, we were\na prey to misery and depression, we couldn’t make a\nliving, we had a feeling of uselessness, we were full of\nfear, we were unhappy, we couldn’t seem to be of real\nhelp to other people — was not a basic solution of these\nbedevilments more important than whether we should\nsee newsreels of lunar flight? Of course it was.\n\nWhen we saw others solve their problems by a simple\nreliance upon the Spirit of the Universe, we had to stop\ndoubting the power of God. Our ideas did not work. But\nthe God idea did.\n\nThe Wright brothers’ almost childish faith that they\ncould build a machine which would fly was the mainspring\nof their accomplishment. Without that, nothing\ncould have happened. We agnostics and atheists were\nsticking to the idea that self-sufficiency would solve our\nproblems. When others showed us that “God-suf\n\n\n\nficiency” worked with them, we began to feel like those\nwho had insisted the Wrights would never fly.\n\nLogic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not\nby chance we were given the power to reason, to examine\nthe evidence of our senses, and to draw conclusions. That\nis one of man’s magnificent attributes. We agnostically\ninclined would not feel satisfied with a proposal which\ndoes not lend itself to reasonable approach and interpretation.\nHence we are at pains to tell why we think our\npresent faith is reasonable, why we think it more sane\nand logical to believe than not to believe, why we say our\nformer thinking was soft and mushy when we threw up\nour hands in doubt and said, “We don’t know.”\n\nWhen we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed\ncrisis we could not postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly\nface the proposition that either God is everything\nor else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn’t. What\nwas our choice to be?\n\nArrived at this point, we were squarely confronted with\nthe question of faith. We couldn’t duck the issue. Some of\nus had already walked far over the Bridge of Reason toward\nthe desired shore of faith. The outlines and the promise of\nthe New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh\ncourage to flagging spirits. Friendly hands had stretched out\nin welcome. We were grateful that Reason had brought us so\nfar. But somehow, we couldn’t quite step ashore. Perhaps\nwe had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and\nwe did not like to lose our support.\n\nThat was natural, but let us think a little more\nclosely. Without knowing it, had we not been brought\nto where we stood by a certain kind of faith? For did\n\n\nwe not believe in our own reasoning? Did we not have\nconfidence in our ability to think? What was that but a\nsort of faith? Yes, we had been faithful, abjectly faithful\nto the God of Reason. So, in one way or another, we\ndiscovered that faith had been involved all the time!\n\nWe found, too, that we had been worshippers. What a\nstate of mental goose-flesh that used to bring on! Had we\nnot variously worshipped people, sentiment, things,\nmoney, and ourselves? And then, with a better motive,\nhad we not worshipfully beheld the sunset, the sea, or a\nflower? Who of us had not loved something or somebody?\nHow much did these feelings, these loves, these\nworships, have to do with pure reason? Little or nothing,\nwe saw at last. Were not these things the tissue out\nof which our lives were constructed? Did not these feelings,\nafter all, determine the course of our existence? It\nwas impossible to say we had no capacity for faith, or\nlove, or worship. In one form or another we had been\nliving by faith and little else.\n\nImagine life without faith! Were nothing left but pure\nreason, it wouldn’t be life. But we believed in life — of\ncourse we did. We could not prove life in the sense that\nyou can prove a straight line is the shortest distance between\ntwo points, yet, there it was. Could we still say\nthe whole thing was nothing but a mass of electrons,\ncreated out of nothing, meaning nothing, whirling on to a\ndestiny of nothingness? Of course we couldn’t. The\nelectrons themselves seemed more intelligent than that.\nAt least, so the chemist said.\n\nHence, we saw that reason isn’t everything. Neither\nis reason, as most of us use it, entirely dependable,\n\n\nthough it emanate from our best minds. What about\npeople who proved that man could never fly?\n\nYet we had been seeing another kind of flight, a spiritual\nliberation from this world, people who rose above their\nproblems. They said God made these things possible,\nand we only smiled. We had seen spiritual release, but\nliked to tell ourselves it wasn’t true.\n\nActually we were fooling ourselves, for deep down in\nevery man, woman, and child, is the fundamental idea of\nGod. It may be obscured by calamity, by pomp, by\nworship of other things, but in some form or other it is\nthere. For faith in a Power greater than ourselves, and\nmiraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives,\nare facts as old as man himself.\n\nWe finally saw that faith in some kind of God was a\npart of our make-up, just as much as the feeling we have\nfor a friend. Sometimes we had to search fearlessly, but\nHe was there. He was as much a fact as we were. We\nfound the Great Reality deep down within us. In the last\nanalysis it is only there that He may be found. It was so\nwith us.\n\nWe can only clear the ground a bit. If our testimony\nhelps sweep away prejudice, enables you to think honestly,\nencourages you to search diligently within yourself,\nthen, if you wish, you can join us on the Broad\nHighway. With this attitude you cannot fail. The\nconsciousness of your belief is sure to come to you.\n\nIn this book you will read the experience of a man\nwho thought he was an atheist. His story is so interesting\nthat some of it should be told now. His change\nof heart was dramatic, convincing, and moving.\n\n\nOur friend was a minister’s son. He attended church\nschool, where he became rebellious at what he thought an\noverdose of religious education. For years thereafter he\nwas dogged by trouble and frustration. Business failure,\ninsanity, fatal illness, suicide — these calamities in his\nimmediate family embittered and depressed him. Postwar\ndisillusionment, ever more serious alcoholism, impending\nmental and physical collapse, brought him to the\npoint of self-destruction.\n\nOne night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached\nby an alcoholic who had known a spiritual experience.\nOur friend’s gorge rose as he bitterly cried out:\n“If there is a God, He certainly hasn’t done anything for\nme!” But later, alone in his room, he asked himself this\nquestion: “Is it possible that all the religious people I\nhave known are wrong?” While pondering the answer he\nfelt as though he lived in hell. Then, like a thunderbolt, a\ngreat thought came. It crowded out all else:\n\n“Who are you to say there is no God?”\n\nThis man recounts that he tumbled out of bed to his\nknees. In a few seconds he was overwhelmed by a conviction\nof the Presence of God. It poured over and through\nhim with the certainty and majesty of a great tide at\nflood. The barriers he had built through the years were\nswept away. He stood in the Presence of Infinite Power\nand Love. He had stepped from bridge to shore. For the\nfirst time, he lived in conscious companionship with his\nCreator.\n\nThus was our friend’s cornerstone fixed in place. No\nlater vicissitude has shaken it. His alcoholic problem\nwas taken away. That very night, years ago, it dis\n\n\n\nappeared. Save for a few brief moments of temptation\nthe thought of drink has never returned; and at such times\na great revulsion has risen up in him. Seemingly he could\nnot drink even if he would. God had restored his sanity.\nWhat is this but a miracle of healing? Yet its elements\nare simple. Circumstances made him willing to believe.\nHe humbly offered himself to his Maker — then he knew.\n\nEven so has God restored us all to our right minds. To\nthis man, the revelation was sudden. Some of us grow\ninto it more slowly. But He has come to all who have\nhonestly sought Him.\n\nWhen we drew near to Him He disclosed Himself to us!\n\nNotes\n\n1 Columbus: Christopher Columbus, Italian explorer often credited\nwith the discovery of N. America in 1492.\n\n2 Galileo: Galileo Galilei, Italian physicist and astronomer persecuted\nfor his belief that the Earth rotated around the sun.

Those who do not recover\nare people who cannot or will not completely give themselves\nto this simple program, usually men and women\nwho are constitutionally incapable of being honest with\nthemselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not\nat fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are\nnaturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner\nof living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances\nare less than average. There are those, too, who suffer\nfrom grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of\nthem do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.\nOur stories disclose in a general way what we used to\nbe like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you\nhave decided you want what we have and are willing to\ngo to any length to get it-then you are ready to take\ncertain steps.\nAt some of these we balked. We thought we could find\nan easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the\nearnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless\nand thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried\nto hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we\nlet go absolutely.\nRemember that we deal with alcohol-cunning, baf\n\n\n\nfling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But\nthere is One who has all power-that One is God. May\nyou find Him now!\n\nHalf measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning\npoint. We asked His protection and care with complete\nabandon.\n\nHere are the steps we took, which are suggested as a\nprogram of recovery:\n\n1.Weadmitted we were powerless over alcohol- that\nour lives had become unmanageable.\n\n2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves\ncould restore us to sanity.\n3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over\nto the care of God as we understood Him.\n4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of\nourselves.\n5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human\nbeing the exact nature of our wrongs.\n6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these\ndefects of character.\n7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.\n8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became\nwilling to make amends to them all.\n9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible,\nexcept when to do so would injure them or others.\n10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we\nwere wrong promptly admitted it.\n11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve\nour conscious contact with God as we understood\nHim, praying only for knowledge of His will for us\nand the power to carry that out.\n\n\n\n12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of\nthese steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics,\nand to practice these principles in all our\naffairs.\n\n\nMany of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through\nwith it.” Do not be discouraged. No one among us has\nbeen able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to\nthese principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we\nare willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles\nwe have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual\nprogress rather than spiritual perfection.\n\nOur description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic,\nand our personal adventures before and after make\nclear three pertinent ideas:\n\n(a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our\nown lives.\n(b) That probably no human power could have relieved\nour alcoholism.\n(c) That God could and would if He were sought.\n\n\nBeing convinced, we were at Step Three, which is that\nwe decided to turn our will and our life over to God as we\nunderstood Him. Just what do we mean by that, and just\nwhat do we do?\n\nThe first requirement is that we be convinced that\nany life run on self-will can hardly be a success. On\nthat basis we are almost always in collision with something\nor somebody, even though our motives are good.\nMost people try to live by self-propulsion. Each person\nis like an actor who wants to run the whole show;\nis forever trying to arrange the lights, the ballet, the\nscenery and the rest of the players in his own way. If\n\n\nhis arrangements would only stay put, if only people\nwould do as he wished, the show would be great. Everybody,\nincluding himself, would be pleased. Life would be\nwonderful. In trying to make these arrangements our\nactor may sometimes be quite virtuous. He may be kind,\nconsiderate, patient, generous; even modest and self-sacrificing.\nOn the other hand, he may be mean, egotistical,\nselfish and dishonest. But, as with most humans, he is\nmore likely to have varied traits.\n\nWhat usually happens? The show doesn’t come off\nvery well. He begins to think life doesn’t treat him right.\nHe decides to exert himself more. He becomes, on the\nnext occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the\ncase may be. Still the play does not suit him. Admitting\nhe may be somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people\nare more to blame. He becomes angry, indignant, self-\npitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he not really a self-\nseeker even when trying to be kind? Is he not a victim of\nthe delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness\nout of this world if he only manages well? Is it not\nevident to all the rest of the players that these are the\nthings he wants? And do not his actions make each of\nthem wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of\nthe show? Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer\nof confusion rather than harmony?\n\nOur actor is self-centered—ego-centric, as people like\nto call it nowadays. He is like the retired business man\nwho lolls in the Florida sunshine in the winter complaining\nof the sad state of the nation; the minister who\nsighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians\nand reformers who are sure all would be Utopia\n\n\nif the rest of the world would only behave; the outlaw\nsafe cracker who thinks society has wronged him; and\nthe alcoholic who has lost all and is locked up. Whatever\nour protestations, are not most of us concerned with\nourselves, our resentments, or our self-pity?\n\nSelfishness—self-centeredness! That, we think, is the\nroot of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear,\nself-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the\ntoes of our fellows and they retaliate. Sometimes they\nhurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we invariably\nfind that at some time in the past we have made decisions\nbased on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt.\n\nSo our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making.\nThey arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an\nextreme example of self-will run riot, though he usually\ndoesn’t think so. Above everything, we alcoholics must\nbe rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kills us! God\nmakes that possible. And there often seems no way of\nentirely getting rid of self without His aid. Many of us had\nmoral and philosophical convictions galore, but we could\nnot live up to them even though we would have liked to.\nNeither could we reduce our self-centeredness much by\nwishing or trying on our own power. We had to have\nGod’s help.\n\nThis is the how and why of it. First of all, we had to quit\nplaying God. It didn’t work. Next, we decided that hereafter\nin this drama of life, God was going to be our Director.\nHe is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and\nwe are His children. Most good ideas are simple, and this\nconcept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch\nthrough which we passed to freedom.\n\n\nWhen we sincerely took such a position, all sorts of remarkable\nthings followed. We had a new Employer. Being\nall powerful, He provided what we needed, if we kept close\nto Him and performed His work well. Established on such\na footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our\nlittle plans and designs. More and more we became interested\nin seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt\nnew power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we\ndiscovered we could face life successfully, as we became\nconscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of\ntoday, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.\n\nWe were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our\nMaker, as we understood Him: “God, I offer myself to\nThee-to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.\nRelieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do\nThy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over\nthem may bear witness to those I would help of Thy\nPower, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy\nwill always!” We thought well before taking this step\nmaking sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon\nourselves utterly to Him.\n\nWe found it very desirable to take this spiritual step\nwith an understanding person, such as our wife, best\nfriend or spiritual adviser. But it is better to meet God\nalone than with one who might misunderstand. The wording\nwas, of course, quite optional so long as we expressed\nthe idea, voicing it without reservation. This was only a\nbeginning, though if honestly and humbly made, an effect,\nsometimes a very great one, was felt at once.\n\nNext we launched out on a course of vigorous action,\nthe first step of which is a personal housecleaning,\n\n\nwhich many of us had never attempted. Though our\ndecision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little\npermanent effect unless at once followed by a strenuous\neffort to face, and to be rid of, the things in ourselves\nwhich had been blocking us. Our liquor was but a symptom.\nSo we had to get down to causes and conditions.\n\nTherefore, we started upon a personal inventory. This\nwas Step Four. A business which takes no regular inventory\nusually goes broke. Taking a commercial inventory\nis a fact-finding and a fact-facing process. It is an effort\nto discover the truth about the stock-in-trade. One object\nis to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, to get rid\nof them promptly and without regret. If the owner of the\nbusiness is to be successful, he cannot fool himself about\nvalues.\n\nWe did exactly the same thing with our lives. We took\nstock honestly. First, we searched out the flaws in our\nmake-up which caused our failure. Being convinced that\nself, manifested in various ways, was what had defeated\nus, we considered its common manifestations.\n\nResentment is the “number one” offender. It destroys\nmore alcoholics than anything else. From it\nstem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been\nnot only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually\nsick. When the spiritual malady is overcome, we\nstraighten out mentally and physically. In dealing with\nresentments, we set them on paper. We listed people,\ninstitutions or principles with whom we were angry.\nWe asked ourselves why we were angry. In most cases\nit was found that our self-esteem, our pocketbooks,\nour ambitions, our personal relationships\n\n\n(including sex) were hurt or threatened. So we were sore.\nWe were “burned up.”\n\nOn our grudge list we set opposite each name our injuries.\nWas it our self-esteem, our security, our ambitions,\nour personal, or sex relations, which had been interfered\nwith?\n\nWe were usually as definite as this example:\n\n I’m resentful at: The Cause Affects my:\n\nMr. Brown His attention to my Sex relations.\nwife. Self-esteem (fear)\nTold my wife of my Sex relations.\nmistress. Self-esteem (fear)\nBrown may get my Security.\njob at the office.

Likes Brown. sex relations Wants\nhouse put in Security (fear)\nher name.\n\nWe went back through our lives. Nothing counted\nbut thoroughness and honesty. When we were finished\nwe considered it carefully. The first thing ap\n\n\n\nparent was that this world and its people were often quite\nwrong. To conclude that others were wrong was as far as\nmost of us ever got. The usual outcome was that people\ncontinued to wrong us and we stayed sore. Sometimes it\nwas remorse and then we were sore at ourselves. But the\nmore we fought and tried to have our own way, the worse\nmatters got. As in war, the victor onlyseemed to win. Our\nmoments of triumph were short-lived.\n\nIt is plain that a life which includes deep resentment leads\nonly to futility and unhappiness. To the precise extent that\nwe permit these, do we squander the hours that might have\nbeen worth while. But with the alcoholic, whose hope is\nthe maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience, this\nbusiness of resentment is infinitely grave. We found that it\nis fatal. For when harboring such feelings we shut ourselves\noff from the sunlight of the Spirit. The insanity of alcohol\nreturns and we drink again. And with us, to drink is to die.\n\nIf we were to live, we had to be free of anger. The grouch\nand the brainstorm were not for us. They may be the\ndubious luxury of normal men, but for alcoholics these things\nare poison.\n\nWe turned back to the list, for it held the key to the future.\nWe were prepared to look at it from an entirely different\nangle. We began to see that the world and its people really\ndominated us. In that state, the wrong-doing of others,\nfancied or real, had power to actually kill. How could we\nescape? We saw that these resentments must be mastered,\nbut how? We could not wish them away any more than\nalcohol.\n\nThis was our course: We realized that the people\nwho wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick.\n\n\nThough we did not like their symptoms and the way\nthese disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too.\nWe asked God to help us show them the same tolerance,\npity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant\na sick friend. When a person offended we said to\nourselves, “This is a sick man. How can I be helpful\nto him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be\ndone.”\n\nWe avoid retaliation or argument. We wouldn’t treat\nsick people that way. If we do, we destroy our chance of\nbeing helpful. We cannot be helpful to all people, but at\nleast God will show us how to take a kindly and tolerant\nview of each and every one.\n\nReferring to our list again. Putting out of our minds the\nwrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our\nown mistakes. Where had we been selfish, dishonest,\nself-seeking and frightened? Though a situation had not\nbeen entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other\nperson involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The\ninventory was ours, not the other man’s. When we saw\nour faults we listed them. We placed them before us in\nblack and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and\nwere willing to set these matters straight.\n\nNotice that the word “fear” is bracketed alongside the\ndifficulties with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the employer,\nand the wife. This short word somehow touches about\nevery aspect of our lives. It was an evil and corroding\nthread; the fabric of our existence was shot through with\nit. It set in motion trains of circumstances which brought\nus misfortune we felt we didn’t deserve. But did not\nwe, ourselves, set the ball rolling? Sometimes\n\n\nwe think fear ought to be classed with stealing. It seems\nto cause more trouble.\n\nWe reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on paper,\neven though we had no resentment in connection with them.\nWe asked ourselves why we had them. Wasn’t it because\nself-reliance failed us? Self-reliance was good as far as it\nwent, but it didn’t go far enough. Some of us once had great\nself-confidence, but it didn’t fully solve the fear problem, or\nany other. When it made us cocky, it was worse.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way—we think so. For we are\nnow on a different basis; the basis of trusting and relying\nupon God. We trust infinite God rather than our finite\nselves. We are in the world to play the role He assigns.\nJust to the extent that we do as we think He would have\nus, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match\ncalamity with serenity.\n\nWe never apologize to anyone for depending upon our\nCreator. We can laugh at those who think spirituality the\nway of weakness. Paradoxically, it is the way of strength.\nThe verdict of the ages is that faith means courage. All\nmen of faith have courage. They trust their God. We\nnever apologize for God. Instead we let Him demonstrate,\nthrough us, what He can do. We ask Him to remove\nour fear and direct our attention to what He would\nhave us be. At once, we commence to outgrow fear.\n\nNow about sex. Many of us needed an overhauling\nthere. But above all, we tried to be sensible on this\nquestion. It’s so easy to get way off the track. Here we\nfind human opinions running to extremes—absurd extremes,\nperhaps. One set of voices cry that sex is a lust\nof our lower nature, a base necessity of procrea\n\n\n\ntion. Then we have the voices who cry for sex and more sex;\nwho bewail the institution of marriage; who think that most\nof the troubles of the race are traceable to sex causes. They\nthink we do not have enough of it, or that it isn’t the right\nkind. They see its significance everywhere. One school\nwould allow man no flavor for his fare and the other would\nhave us all on a straight pepper diet. We want to stay out of\nthis controversy. We do not want to be the arbiter of anyone’s\nsex conduct. We all have sex problems. We’d hardly be\nhuman if we didn’t. What can we do about them?\n\nWe reviewed our own conduct over the years past. Where\nhad we been selfish, dishonest, or inconsiderate? Whom\nhad we hurt? Did we unjustifiably arouse jealousy, suspicion\nor bitterness? Where were we at fault, what should\nwe have done instead? We got this all down on paper and\nlooked at it.\n\nIn this way we tried to shape a sane and sound ideal for\nour future sex life. We subjected each relation to this test—\nwas it selfish or not? We asked God to mold our ideals and\nhelp us to live up to them. We remembered always that\nour sex powers were God-given and therefore good, neither\nto be used lightly or selfishly nor to be despised and\nloathed.\n\nWhatever our ideal turns out to be, we must be willing to\ngrow toward it. We must be willing to make amends where\nwe have done harm, provided that we do not bring about\nstill more harm in so doing. In other words, we treat sex as\nwe would any other problem. In meditation, we ask God\nwhat we should do about each specific matter. The right\nanswer will come, if we want it.\n\nGod alone can judge our sex situation. Counsel with\n\n\npersons is often desirable, but we let God be the final\njudge. We realize that some people are as fanatical about\nsex as others are loose. We avoid hysterical thinking or\nadvice.\n\nSuppose we fall short of the chosen ideal and stumble?\nDoes this mean we are going to get drunk? Some people\ntell us so. But this is only a half-truth. It depends on us\nand on our motives. If we are sorry for what we have\ndone, and have the honest desire to let God take us to\nbetter things, we believe we will be forgiven and will\nhave learned our lesson. If we are not sorry, and our\nconduct continues to harm others, we are quite sure to\ndrink. We are not theorizing. These are facts out of our\nexperience.\n\nTo sum up about sex: We earnestly pray for the right\nideal, for guidance in each questionable situation, for\nsanity, and for the strength to do the right thing. If sex\nis very troublesome, we throw ourselves the harder into\nhelping others. We think of their needs and work for\nthem. This takes us out of ourselves. It quiets the\nimperious urge, when to yield would mean heartache.\n\nIf we have been thorough about our personal inventory,\nwe have written down a lot. We have listed and analyzed\nour resentments. We have begun to comprehend their\nfutility and their fatality. We have commenced to see\ntheir terrible destructiveness. We have begun to learn\ntolerance, patience and good will toward all men, even\nour enemies, for we look on them as sick people. We\nhave listed the people we have hurt by our conduct, and\nare willing to straighten out the past if we can.\n\nIn this book you read again and again that faith did\n\n\nfor us what we could not do for ourselves. We hope you\nare convinced now that God can remove whatever self-\nwill has blocked you off from Him. If you have already\nmade a decision, and an inventory of your grosser handicaps,\nyou have made a good beginning. That being so\nyou have swallowed and digested some big chunks of\ntruth about yourself.\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n INTO ACTION\n\nH\nH\nAVING MADE our personal inventory, what shall\n\nwe do about it? We have been trying to get a new\n\nattitude, a new relationship with our Creator, and to dis\n\n\ncover the obstacles in our path. We have admitted certain\n\ndefects; we have ascertained in a rough way what the\n\ntrouble is; we have put our finger on the weak items in\n\nour personal inventory. Now these are about to be cast\n\nout. This requires action on our part, which, when com\n\n\npleted, will mean that we have admitted to God, to our\n\n\nselves, and to another human being, the exact nature of\n\nour defects. This brings us to the Fifth Step in the pro\n\n\ngram of recovery mentioned in the preceding chapter.\n\nThis is perhaps difficult—especially discussing our\n\ndefects with another person. We think we have done\n\nwell enough in admitting these things to ourselves. There\n\nis doubt about that. In actual practice, we usually find\n\na solitary self-appraisal insufficient. Many of us\n\nthought it necessary to go much further. We will be\n\nmore reconciled to discussing ourselves with another\n\nperson when we see good reasons why we should do\n\nso. The best reason first: If we skip this vital step, we\n\nmay not overcome drinking. Time after time newcom\n\n\ners have tried to keep to themselves certain facts about\n\ntheir lives. Trying to avoid this humbling experience,\n\nthey have turned to easier methods. Almost\n\n\ninvariably they got drunk. Having persevered with the\nrest of the program, they wondered why they fell. We\nthink the reason is that they never completed their housecleaning.\nThey took inventory all right, but hung on to\nsome of the worst items in stock. They only thought they\nhad lost their egoism and fear; they onlythought they had\nhumbled themselves. But they had not learned enough of\nhumility, fearlessness and honesty, in the sense we find it\nnecessary, until they told someone else all their life story.\n\nMore than most people, the alcoholic leads a double\nlife. He is very much the actor. To the outer world he\npresents his stage character. This is the one he likes his\nfellows to see. He wants to enjoy a certain reputation,\nbut knows in his heart he doesn’t deserve it.\n\nThe inconsistency is made worse by the things he does\non his sprees. Coming to his senses, he is revolted at\ncertain episodes he vaguely remembers. These memories\nare a nightmare. He trembles to think someone might have\nobserved him. As fast as he can, he pushes these memories\nfar inside himself. He hopes they will never see the\nlight of day. He is under constant fear and tension—that\nmakes for more drinking.\n\nPsychologists are inclined to agree with us. We have\nspent thousands of dollars for examinations. We know but\nfew instances where we have given these doctors a fair\nbreak. We have seldom told them the whole truth nor have\nwe followed their advice. Unwilling to be honest with\nthese sympathetic men, we were honest with no one else.\nSmall wonder many in the medical profession have a low\nopinion of alcoholics and their chance for recovery!\n\nWe must be entirely honest with somebody if we\n\n\nexpect to live long or happily in this world. Rightly and\nnaturally, we think well before we choose the person or\npersons with whom to take this intimate and confidential\nstep. Those of us belonging to a religious denomination\nwhich requires confession must, and of course, will want\nto go to the properly appointed authority whose duty it\nis to receive it. Though we have no religious connection,\nwe may still do well to talk with someone ordained by an\nestablished religion. We often find such a person quick to\nsee and understand our problem. Of course, we sometimes\nencounter people who do not understand alcoholics.\n\n\nIf we cannot or would rather not do this, we search our\nacquaintance for a close-mouthed, understanding friend.\nPerhaps our doctor or psychologist will be the person. It\nmay be one of our own family, but we cannot disclose\nanything to our wives or our parents which will hurt\nthem and make them unhappy. We have no right to save\nour own skin at another person’s expense. Such parts of\nour story we tell to someone who will understand, yet be\nunaffected. The rule is we must be hard on ourself, but\nalways considerate of others.\n\nNotwithstanding the great necessity for discussing\nourselves with someone, it may be one is so situated\nthat there is no suitable person available. If that is so,\nthis step may be postponed, only, however, if we hold\nourselves in complete readiness to go through with it\nat the first opportunity. We say this because we are\nvery anxious that we talk to the right person. It is\nimportant that he be able to keep a confidence; that he\nfully understand and approve what we are driving at;\n\n\nthat he will not try to change our plan. But we must not\nuse this as a mere excuse to postpone.\n\nWhen we decide who is to hear our story, we waste no\ntime. We have a written inventory and we are prepared\nfor a long talk. We explain to our partner what we are\nabout to do and why we have to do it. He should realize\nthat we are engaged upon a life-and-death errand. Most\npeople approached in this way will be glad to help; they\nwill be honored by our confidence.\n\nWe pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every\ntwist of character, every dark cranny of the past. Once\nwe have taken this step, withholding nothing, we are\ndelighted. We can look the world in the eye. We can be\nalone at perfect peace and ease. Our fears fall from us.\nWe begin to feel the nearness of our Creator. We may\nhave had certain spiritual beliefs, but now we begin to\nhave a spiritual experience. The feeling that the drink\nproblem has disappeared will often come strongly. We\nfeel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand\nwith the Spirit of the Universe.\n\nReturning home we find a place where we can be quiet\nfor an hour, carefully reviewing what we have done. We\nthank God from the bottom of our heart that we know\nHim better. Taking this book down from our shelf we\nturn to the page which contains the twelve steps. Carefully\nreading the first five proposals we ask if we have\nomitted anything, for we are building an arch through\nwhich we shall walk a free man at last. Is our work solid\nso far? Are the stones properly in place? Have we\nskimped on the cement put into the foundation? Have\nwe tried to make mortar without sand?\n\n\nIf we can answer to our satisfaction, we then look atStep\nSix. We have emphasized willingness as being indispensable.\nAre we now ready to let God remove from us all the\nthings which we have admitted are objectionable? Can He\nnow take them all—every one? If we still cling to something\nwe will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.\n\nWhen ready, we say something like this: “My Creator,\nI am now willing that you should have all of me, good and\nbad. I pray that you now remove from me every single\ndefect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness\nto you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go\nout from here, to do your bidding. Amen.” We have then\ncompletedStep Seven.\n\nNow we need more action, without which we find that\n“Faith without works is dead.” Let’s look at Steps Eight\nand Nine. We have a list of all persons we have harmed\nand to whom we are willing to make amends. We made it\nwhen we took inventory. We subjected ourselves to a\ndrastic self-appraisal. Now we go out to our fellows and\nrepair the damage done in the past. We attempt to sweep\naway the debris which has accumulated out of our effort\nto live on self-will and run the show ourselves. If we\nhaven’t the will to do this, we ask until it comes. Remember\nit was agreed at the beginning we would go to any\nlengths for victory over alcohol.\n\nProbably there are still some misgivings. As we look\nover the list of business acquaintances and friends we\nhave hurt, we may feel diffident about going to some\nof them on a spiritual basis. Let us be reassured. To\nsome people we need not, and probably should not\nemphasize the spiritual feature on our first approach.\n\n\nWe might prejudice them. At the moment we are trying\nto put our lives in order. But this is not an end in itself.\nOur real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum\nservice to God and the people about us. It is seldom wise\nto approach an individual, who still smarts from our injustice\nto him, and announce that we have gone religious.\nIn the prize ring, this would be called leading with the\nchin. Why lay ourselves open to being branded fanatics\nor religious bores? We may kill a future opportunity to\ncarry a beneficial message. But our man is sure to be\nimpressed with a sincere desire to set right the wrong.\nHe is going to be more interested in a demonstration of\ngood will than in our talk of spiritual discoveries.\n\nWe don’t use this as an excuse for shying away from the\nsubject of God. When it will serve any good purpose, we\nare willing to announce our convictions with tact and\ncommon sense. The question of how to approach the\nman we hated will arise. It may be he has done us more\nharm than we have done him and, though we may have\nacquired a better attitude toward him, we are still not too\nkeen about admitting our faults. Nevertheless, with a\nperson we dislike, we take the bit in our teeth. It is\nharder to go to an enemy than to a friend, but we find it\nmuch more beneficial to us. We go to him in a helpful and\nforgiving spirit, confessing our former ill feeling and expressing\nour regret.\n\nUnder no condition do we criticize such a person or\nargue. Simply we tell him that we will never get over\ndrinking until we have done our utmost to straighten\nout the past. We are there to sweep off our side of\nthe street, realizing that nothing worth while\n\n\ncan be accomplished until we do so, never trying to tell him\nwhat he should do. His faults are not discussed. We stick to\nour own. If our manner is calm, frank, and open, we will be\ngratified with the result.\n\nIn nine cases out of ten the unexpected happens. Sometimes\nthe man we are calling upon admits his own fault, so\nfeuds of years’ standing melt away in an hour. Rarely do we\nfail to make satisfactory progress. Our former enemies\nsometimes praise what we are doing and wish us well. Occasionally,\nthey will offer assistance. It should not matter,\nhowever, if someone does throw us out of his office. We\nhave made our demonstration, done our part. It’s water\nover the dam.\n\nMost alcoholics owe money. We do not dodge our creditors.\nTelling them what we are trying to do, we make no\nbones about our drinking; they usually know it anyway,\nwhether we think so or not. Nor are we afraid of disclosing\nour alcoholism on the theory it may cause financial harm.\nApproached in this way, the most ruthless creditor will\nsometimes surprise us. Arranging the best deal we can we\nlet these people know we are sorry. Our drinking has made\nus slow to pay. We must lose our fear of creditors no matter\nhow far we have to go, for we are liable to drink if we are\nafraid to face them.\n\nPerhaps we have committed a criminal offense which might\nland us in jail if it were known to the authorities. We may be\nshort in our accounts and unable to make good. We have\nalready admitted this in confidence to another person, but we\nare sure we would be imprisoned or lose our job if it were\nknown. Maybe it’s only a petty offense such as padding the\nexpense account. Most of us have done that sort of thing.\n\n\nMaybe we are divorced, and have remarried but haven’t\nkept up the alimony to number one. She is indignant\nabout it, and has a warrant out for our arrest. That’s a\ncommon form of trouble too.\n\nAlthough these reparations take innumerable forms,\nthere are some general principles which we find guiding.\nReminding ourselves that we have decided to go to any\nlengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask that we be\ngiven strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter\nwhat the personal consequences may be. We may\nlose our position or reputation or face jail, but we are\nwilling. We have to be. We must not shrink at anything.\n\nUsually, however, other people are involved. Therefore,\nwe are not to be the hasty and foolish martyr who\nwould needlessly sacrifice others to save himself from\nthe alcoholic pit. A man we know had remarried. Because\nof resentment and drinking, he had not paid alimony\nto his first wife. She was furious. She went to\ncourt and got an order for his arrest. He had commenced\nour way of life, had secured a position, and was getting\nhis head above water. It would have been impressive\nheroics if he had walked up to the Judge and said, “Here\nI am.”\n\nWe thought he ought to be willing to do that if necessary,\nbut if he were in jail he could provide nothing for\neither family. We suggested he write his first wife admitting\nhis faults and asking forgiveness. He did, and also\nsent a small amount of money. He told her what he\nwould try to do in the future. He said he was perfectly\nwilling to go to jail if she insisted. Of course she did not,\nand the whole situation has long since been adjusted.\n\n\nBefore taking drastic action which might implicate other\npeople we secure their consent. If we have obtained\npermission, have consulted with others, asked God to\nhelp and the drastic step is indicated we must not shrink.\n\nThis brings to mind a story about one of our friends.\nWhile drinking, he accepted a sum of money from a\nbitterly-hated business rival, giving him no receipt for\nit. He subsequently denied having received the money\nand used the incident as a basis for discrediting the man.\nHe thus used his own wrong-doing as a means of destroying\nthe reputation of another. In fact, his rival was\nruined.\n\nHe felt that he had done a wrong he could not possibly\nmake right. If he opened that old affair, he was afraid it\nwould destroy the reputation of his partner, disgrace\nhis family and take away his means of livelihood. What\nright had he to involve those dependent upon him? How\ncould he possibly make a public statement exonerating\nhis rival?\n\nAfter consulting with his wife and partner he came to\nthe conclusion that is was better to take those risks than\nto stand before his Creator guilty of such ruinous slander.\nHe saw that he had to place the outcome in God’s hands\nor he would soon start drinking again, and all would be\nlost anyhow. He attended church for the first time in\nmany years. After the sermon, he quietly got up and\nmade an explanation. His action met wide-spread approval,\nand today he is one of the most trusted citizens\nof his town. This all happened years ago.\n\nThe chances are that we have domestic troubles. Perhaps\nwe are mixed up with women in a fashion we\n\n\nwouldn’t care to have advertised. We doubt if, in this\nrespect, alcoholics are fundamentally much worse than\nother people. But drinking does complicate sex relations\nin the home. After a few years with an alcoholic, a wife\ngets worn out, resentful and uncommunicative. How\ncould she be anything else? The husband begins to feel\nlonely, sorry for himself. He commences to look around\nin the night clubs, or their equivalent, for something besides\nliquor. Perhaps he is having a secret and exciting\naffair with “the girl who understands.” In fairness we\nmust say that she may understand, but what are we going\nto do about a thing like that? A man so involved often\nfeels very remorseful at times, especially if he is married\nto a loyal and courageous girl who has literally gone through\nhell for him.\n\nWhatever the situation, we usually have to do something\nabout it. If we are sure our wife does not know,\nshould we tell her? Not always, we think. If she knows\nin a general way that we have been wild, should we tell\nher in detail? Undoubtedly we should admit our fault.\nShe may insist on knowing all the particulars. She will\nwant to know who the woman is and where she is. We\nfeel we ought to say to her that we have no right to\ninvolve another person. We are sorry for what we have\ndone and, God willing, it shall not be repeated. More\nthan that we cannot do; we have no right to go further.\nThough there may be justifiable exceptions, and though\nwe wish to lay down no rule of any sort, we have often\nfound this the best course to take.\n\nOur design for living is not a one-way street. It is as\ngood for the wife as for the husband. If we can\n\n\nforget, so can she. It is better, however, that one does not\nneedlessly name a person upon whom she can vent jealousy.\n\nPerhaps there are some cases where the utmost frankness\nis demanded. No outsider can appraise such an\nintimate situation. It may be that both will decide that\nthe way of good sense and loving kindness is to let bygones\nbe by-gones. Each might pray about it, having the\nother one’s happiness uppermost in mind. Keep it always\nin sight that we are dealing with that most terrible\nhuman emotion-jealousy. Good generalship may decide\nthat the problem be attacked on the flank rather than risk\na face-to-face combat.\n\nIf we have no such complication, there is plenty we\nshould do at home. Sometimes we hear an alcoholic say\nthat the only thing he needs to do is to keep sober. Certainly\nhe must keep sober, for there will be no home if he\ndoesn’t. But he is yet a long way from making good to\nthe wife or parents whom for years he has so shockingly\ntreated. Passing all understanding is the patience mothers\nand wives have had with alcoholics. Had this not\nbeen so, many of us would have no homes today, would\nperhaps be dead.\n\nThe alcoholic is like a tornado roaring his way through\nthe lives of others. Hearts are broken. Sweet relationships\nare dead. Affections have been uprooted. Selfish\nand inconsiderate habits have kept the home in turmoil.\nWe feel a man is unthinking when he says that sobriety is\nenough. He is like the farmer who came up out of his\ncyclone cellar to find his home ruined. To his wife, he\nremarked, “Don’t see anything the matter here, Ma. Ain’t\nit grand the wind stopped blowin’?”\n\n\nYes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead. We\nmust take the lead. A remorseful mumbling that we are\nsorry won’t fill the bill at all. We ought to sit down with\nthe family and frankly analyze the past as we now see it,\nbeing very careful not to criticize them. Their defects may\nbe glaring, but the chances are that our own actions are\npartly responsible. So we clean house with the family,\nasking each morning in meditation that our Creator show\nus the way of patience, tolerance, kindliness and love.\n\nThe spiritual life is not a theory. We have to live it.\nUnless one’s family expresses a desire to live upon spiritual\nprinciples we think we ought not to urge them. We\nshould not talk incessantly to them about spiritual matters.\nThey will change in time. Our behavior will convince\nthem more than our words. We must remember\nthat ten or twenty years of drunkenness would make a\nskeptic out of anyone.\n\nThere may be some wrongs we can never fully right.\nWe don’t worry about them if we can honestly say to\nourselves that we would right them if we could. Some\npeople cannot be seen—we send them an honest letter.\nAnd there may be a valid reason for postponement in\nsome cases. But we don’t delay if it can be avoided. We\nshould be sensible, tactful, considerate and humble without\nbeing servile or scraping. As God’s people we stand\non our feet; we don’t crawl before anyone.\n\nIf we are painstaking about this phase of our development,\nwe will be amazed before we are half way\nthrough. We are going to know a new freedom and a\nnew happiness. We will not regret the past nor wish\nto shut the door on it. We will comprehend the\n\n\nword serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far\ndown the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience\ncan benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-\npity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things\nand gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away.\nOur whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear\nof people and of economic insecurity will leave us. We will\nintuitively know how to handle situations which used to\nbaffle us. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us\nwhat we could not do for ourselves.\n\nAre these extravagant promises? We think not. They\nare being fulfilled among us—sometimes quickly, sometimes\nslowly. They will always materialize if we work\nfor them.\n\nThis thought brings us to Step Ten, which suggests we\ncontinue to take personal inventory and continue to set\nright any new mistakes as we go along. We vigorously\ncommenced this way of living as we cleaned up the past.\nWe have entered the world of the Spirit. Our next function\nis to grow in understanding and effectiveness. This is not\nan overnight matter. It should continue for our lifetime.\nContinue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment,\nand fear. When these crop up, we ask God at once to\nremove them. We discuss them with someone immediately\nand make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone.\nThen we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can\nhelp. Love and tolerance of others is our code.\n\nAnd we have ceased fighting anything or anyone—\neven alcohol. For by this time sanity will have returned.\nWe will seldom be interested in liquor. If\ntempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We\n\n\nreact sanely and normally, and we will find that this has\nhappened automatically. We will see that our new attitude\ntoward liquor has been given us without any thought\nor effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle\nof it. We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding\ntemptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a\nposition of neutrality—safe and protected. We have not\neven sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.\nIt does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we\nafraid. That is our experience. That is how we react so\nlong as we keep in fit spiritual condition.\n\nIt is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action\nand rest on our laurels. We are headed for trouble if we\ndo, for alcohol is a subtle foe. We are not cured of alcoholism.\nWhat we really have is a daily reprieve contingent\non the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every\nday is a day when we must carry the vision of God’s\nwill into all of our activities. “How can I best serve\nThee—Thy will (not mine) be done.” These are thoughts\nwhich must go with us constantly. We can exercise our\nwill power along this line all we wish. It is the proper use\nof the will.\n\nMuch has already been said about receiving strength,\ninspiration, and direction from Him who has all knowledge\nand power. If we have carefully followed directions,\nwe have begun to sense the flow of His Spirit into\nus. To some extent we have become God-conscious. We\nhave begun to develop this vital sixth sense. But we\nmust go further and that means more action.\n\nStep Eleven suggests prayer and meditation. We\nshouldn’t be shy on this matter of prayer. Better men\n\n\nthan we are using it constantly. It works, if we have the\nproper attitude and work at it. It would be easy to be\nvague about this matter. Yet, we believe we can make\nsome definite and valuable suggestions.\n\nWhen we retire at night, we constructively review our\nday. Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid? Do\nwe owe an apology? Have we kept something to ourselves\nwhich should be discussed with another person at\nonce? Were we kind and loving toward all? What could\nwe have done better? Were we thinking of ourselves\nmost of the time? Or were we thinking of what we could\ndo for others, of what we could pack into the stream of\nlife? But we must be careful not to drift into worry,\nremorse or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our\nusefulness to others. After making our review we ask\nGod’s forgiveness and inquire what corrective measures\nshould be taken.\n\nOn awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours\nahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we\nbegin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking\nthat it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking\nmotives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental\nfaculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains\nto use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher\nplane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives.\n\nIn thinking about our day we may face indecision.\nWe may not be able to determine which course to\ntake. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive\nthought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We\ndon’t struggle. We are often surprised how the right\nanswers come after we have tried this for a while.\n\n\nWhat used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration\ngradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still\ninexperienced and having just made conscious contact with\nGod, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at\nall times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of\nabsurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our\nthinking will, as time passes, be more and more on the\nplane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it.\n\nWe usually conclude the period of meditation with a\nprayer that we be shown all through the day what our\nnext step is to be, that we be given whatever we need to\ntake care of such problems. We ask especially for freedom\nfrom self-will, and are careful to make no request for\nourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if\nothers will be helped. We are careful never to pray for\nour own selfish ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of\ntime doing that and it doesn’t work. You can easily see\nwhy.\n\nIf circumstances warrant, we ask our wives or friends\nto join us in morning meditation. If we belong to a religious\ndenomination which requires a definite morning\ndevotion, we attend to that also. If not members of religious\nbodies, we sometimes select and memorize a few\nset prayers which emphasize the principles we have been\ndiscussing. There are many helpful books also. Suggestions\nabout these may be obtained from one’s priest,\nminister, or rabbi. Be quick to see where religious people\nare right. Make use of what they offer.\n\nAs we go through the day we pause, when agitated\nor doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action.\nWe constantly remind ourselves we are no longer\n\n\nrunning the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times\neach day “Thy will be done.” We are then in much less\ndanger of excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish\ndecisions. We become much more efficient. We do\nnot tire so easily, for we are not burning up energy foolishly\nas we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit\nourselves.\n\nIt works—it really does.\n\nWe alcoholics are undisciplined. So we let God discipline\nus in the simple way we have just outlined.\n\nBut this is not all. There is action and more action.\n“Faith without works is dead.” The next chapter is entirely\ndevoted toStep Twelve.\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nWORKING WITH OTHERS\n\nP\nP\nRACTICAL EXPERIENCE shows that nothing will\n\nso much insure immunity from drinking as intensive\n\nwork with other alcoholics. It works when other activi\n\n\nties fail. This is our twelfth suggestion: Carry this mes\n\n\nsage to other alcoholics! You can help when no one else\n\ncan. You can secure their confidence when others fail.\n\nRemember they are very ill.\n\nLife will take on new meaning. To watch people re\n\n\ncover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness van\n\n\nish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host\n\nof friends—this is an experience you must not miss. We\n\nknow you will not want to miss it. Frequent contact\n\nwith newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of\n\nour lives.\n\nPerhaps you are not acquainted with any drinkers who\n\nwant to recover. You can easily find some by asking a\n\nfew doctors, ministers, priests or hospitals. They will\n\nbe only too glad to assist you. Don’t start out as an\n\nevangelist or reformer. Unfortunately a lot of prejudice\n\nexists. You will be handicapped if you arouse it. Minis\n\n\nters and doctors are competent and you can learn much\n\nfrom them if you wish, but it happens that because of\n\nyour own drinking experience you can be uniquely useful\n\nto other alcoholics. So cooperate; never criticize. To be\n\nhelpful is our only aim.\n\n\nWhen you discover a prospect for Alcoholics Anonymous,\nfind out all you can about him. If he does not want\nto stop drinking, don’t waste time trying to persuade\nhim. You may spoil a later opportunity. This advice is\ngiven for his family also. They should be patient, realizing\nthey are dealing with a sick person.\n\nIf there is any indication that he wants to stop, have a\ngood talk with the person most interested in him—usually\nhis wife. Get an idea of his behavior, his problems,\nhis background, the seriousness of his condition, and his\nreligious leanings. You need this information to put yourself\nin his place, to see how you would like him to approach\nyou if the tables were turned.\n\nSometimes it is wise to wait till he goes on a binge. The\nfamily may object to this, but unless he is in a dangerous\nphysical condition, it is better to risk it. Don’t deal with\nhim when he is very drunk, unless he is ugly and the\nfamily needs your help. Wait for the end of the spree, or\nat least for a lucid interval. Then let his family or a friend\nask him if he wants to quit for good and if he would go to\nany extreme to do so. If he says yes, then his attention\nshould be drawn to you as a person who has recovered.\nYou should be described to him as one of a fellowship\nwho, as part of their own recovery, try to help others and\nwho will be glad to talk to him if he cares to see you.\n\nIf he does not want to see you, never force yourself upon\nhim. Neither should the family hysterically plead with him to\ndo anything, nor should they tell him much about you. They\nshould wait for the end of his next drinking bout. You might\nplace this book where he can see it in the interval. Here no\nspecific rule can be given. The family must decide these\n\n\nthings. But urge them not to be over-anxious, for that\nmight spoil matters.\n\nUsually the family should not try to tell your story.\nWhen possible, avoid meeting a man through his family.\nApproach through a doctor or an institution is a better\nbet. If your man needs hospitalization, he should have\nit, but not forcibly unless he is violent. Let the doctor,\nif he will, tell him he has something in the way of a\nsolution.\n\nWhen your man is better, the doctor might suggest a\nvisit from you. Though you have talked with the family,\nleave them out of the first discussion. Under these conditions\nyour prospect will see he is under no pressure.\nHe will feel he can deal with you without being nagged by\nhis family. Call on him while he is still jittery. He may be\nmore receptive when depressed.\n\nSee your man alone, if possible. At first engage in general\nconversation. After a while, turn the talk to some\nphase of drinking. Tell him enough about your drinking\nhabits, symptoms, and experiences to encourage him to\nspeak of himself. If he wishes to talk, let him do so. You\nwill thus get a better idea of how you ought to proceed.\nIf he is not communicative, give him a sketch of your\ndrinking career up to the time you quit. But say nothing,\nfor the moment, of how that was accomplished. If he is\nin a serious mood dwell on the troubles liquor has caused\nyou, being careful not to moralize or lecture. If his mood\nis light, tell him humorous stories of your escapades.\nGet him to tell some of his.\n\nWhen he sees you know all about the drinking game,\ncommence to describe yourself as an alcoholic.\n\n\nTell him how baffled you were, how you finally learned\nthat you were sick. Give him an account of the struggles\nyou made to stop. Show him the mental twist which\nleads to the first drink of a spree. We suggest you do this\nas we have done it in the chapter on alcoholism. If he is\nalcoholic, he will understand you at once. He will match\nyour mental inconsistencies with some of his own.\n\nIf you are satisfied that he is a real alcoholic, begin to\ndwell on the hopeless feature of the malady. Show him,\nfrom your own experience, how the queer mental condition\nsurrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning\nof the will power. Don’t, at this stage, refer to this\nbook, unless he has seen it and wishes to discuss it. And\nbe careful not to brand him as an alcoholic. Let him draw\nhis own conclusion. If he sticks to the idea that he can still\ncontrol his drinking, tell him that possibly he can—if he is\nnot too alcoholic. But insist that if he is severely afflicted,\nthere may be little chance he can recover by himself.\n\nContinue to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a fatal\nmalady. Talk about the conditions of body and mind\nwhich accompany it. Keep his attention focused\nmainly on your personal experience. Explain that\nmany are doomed who never realize their predicament.\nDoctors are rightly loath to tell alcoholic patients the\nwhole story unless it will serve some good purpose.\nBut you may talk to him about the hopelessness of\nalcoholism because you offer a solution. You will soon\nhave your friend admitting he has many, if not all, of\nthe traits of the alcoholic. If his own doctor is willing\nto tell him that he is alcoholic, so much the better.\nEven though your protégé may not have en\n\n\n\ntirely admitted his condition, he has become very curious\nto know how you got well. Let him ask you that question,\nif he will. Tell him exactly what happened to you. Stress\nthe spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or atheist,\nmake it emphatic thathe does not have to agree with\nyour conception of God. He can choose any conception he\nlikes, provided it makes sense to him. The main thing is\nthat he be willing to believe in a Power greater than himself\nand that he live by spiritual principles.\n\nWhen dealing with such a person, you had better use\neveryday language to describe spiritual principles. There\nis no use arousing any prejudice he may have against\ncertain theological terms and conceptions about which he\nmay already be confused. Don’t raise such issues, no\nmatter what your own convictions are.\n\nYour prospect may belong to a religious denomination.\nHis religious education and training may be far\nsuperior to yours. In that case he is going to wonder\nhow you can add anything to what he already knows.\nBut he will be curious to learn why his own convictions\nhave not worked and why yours seem to work so\nwell. He may be an example of the truth that faith\nalone is insufficient. To be vital, faith must be accompanied\nby self sacrifice and unselfish, constructive action.\nLet him see that you are not there to instruct him\nin religion. Admit that he probably knows more about\nit than you do, but call to his attention the fact that\nhowever deep his faith and knowledge, he could not\nhave applied it or he would not drink. Perhaps your\nstory will help him see where he has failed to practice\nthe very precepts he knows so well. We represent no\n\n\nparticular faith or denomination. We are dealing only\nwith general principles common to most denominations.\n\nOutline the program of action, explaining how you\nmade a self-appraisal, how you straightened out your\npast and why you are now endeavoring to be helpful to\nhim. It is important for him to realize that your attempt\nto pass this on to him plays a vital part in your\nown recovery. Actually, he may be helping you more\nthan you are helping him. Make it plain he is under no\nobligation to you, that you hope only that he will try to\nhelp other alcoholics when he escapes his own difficulties.\nSuggest how important it is that he place the welfare\nof other people ahead of his own. Make it clear\nthat he is not under pressure, that he needn’t see you\nagain if he doesn’t want to. You should not be offended\nif he wants to call it off, for he has helped you more\nthan you have helped him. If your talk has been sane,\nquiet and full of human understanding, you have perhaps\nmade a friend. Maybe you have disturbed him\nabout the question of alcoholism. This is all to the\ngood. The more hopeless he feels, the better. He will be\nmore likely to follow your suggestions.\n\nYour candidate may give reasons why he need not\nfollow all of the program. He may rebel at the thought\nof a drastic housecleaning which requires discussion\nwith other people. Do not contradict such views.\nTell him you once felt as he does, but you doubt\nwhether you would have made much progress had\nyou not taken action. On your first visit tell him\nabout the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. If\nhe shows interest, lend him your copy of this book.\n\n\nUnless your friend wants to talk further about himself,\ndo not wear out your welcome. Give him a chance to\nthink it over. If you do stay, let him steer the conversation\nin any direction he likes. Sometimes a new man is\nanxious to proceed at once. And you may be tempted to\nlet him do so. This is sometimes a mistake. If he has\ntrouble later, he is likely to say you rushed him. You will\nbe most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit\nany passion for crusade or reform. Never talk down to\nan alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply\nlay out the kit of spiritual tools for his inspection. Show\nhim how they worked with you. Offer him friendship\nand fellowship. Tell him that if he wants to get well you\nwill do anything to help.\n\nIf he is not interested in your solution, if he expects you to\nact only as a banker for his financial difficulties or a nurse for\nhis sprees, you may have to drop him until he changes his\nmind. This he may do after he gets hurt some more.\n\nIf he is sincerely interested and wants to see you again,\nask him to read this book in the interval. After doing\nthat, he must decide for himself whether he wants to go\non. He should not be pushed or prodded by you, his\nwife, or his friends. If he is to find God, the desire must\ncome from within.\n\nIf he thinks he can do the job in some other way, or\nprefers some other spiritual approach, encourage him\nto follow his own conscience. We have no monopoly\non God; we merely have an approach that worked with\nus. But point out that we alcoholics have much in common\nand that you would like, in any case, to be friendly.\nLet it go at that.\n\n\nDo not be discouraged if your prospect does not respond\nat once. Search out another alcoholic and try again.\nYou are sure to find someone desperate enough to accept\nwith eagerness what you offer. We find it a waste of time\nto keep chasing a man who cannot or will not work with\nyou. If you leave such a person alone, he may soon\nbecome convinced that he cannot recover by himself. To\nspend too much time on any one situation is to deny\nsome other alcoholic an opportunity to live and be happy.\nOne of our Fellowship failed entirely with his first half\ndozen prospects. He often says that if he had continued\nto work on them, he might have deprived many others,\nwho have since recovered, of their chance.\n\nSuppose now you are making your second visit to a\nman. He has read this volume and says he is prepared to\ngo through with the Twelve Steps of the program of recovery.\nHaving had the experience yourself, you can give\nhim much practical advice. Let him know you are available\nif he wishes to make a decision and tell his story, but\ndo not insist upon it if he prefers to consult someone\nelse.\n\nHe may be broke and homeless. If he is, you might\ntry to help him about getting a job, or give him a little\nfinancial assistance. But you should not deprive your\nfamily or creditors of money they should have. Perhaps\nyou will want to take the man into your home for\na few days. But be sure you use discretion. Be certain\nhe will be welcomed by your family, and that he is not\ntrying to impose upon you for money, connections, or\nshelter. Permit that and you only harm him. You will\nbe making it possible for him to be insincere.\n\n\nYou may be aiding in his destruction rather than his recovery.\n\n\nNever avoid these responsibilities, but be sure you are\ndoing the right thing if you assume them. Helping others\nis the foundation stone of your recovery. A kindly act\nonce in a while isn’t enough. You have to act the Good\nSamaritan every day, if need be. It may mean the loss of\nmany nights’ sleep, great interference with your pleasures,\ninterruptions to your business. It may mean sharing\nyour money and your home, counseling frantic wives\nand relatives, innumerable trips to police courts, sanitariums,\nhospitals, jails and asylums. Your telephone may\njangle at any time of the day or night. Your wife may\nsometimes say she is neglected. A drunk may smash the\nfurniture in your home, or burn a mattress. You may\nhave to fight with him if he is violent. Sometimes you\nwill have to call a doctor and administer sedatives under\nhis direction. Another time you may have to send for the\npolice or an ambulance. Occasionally you will have to\nmeet such conditions.\n\nWe seldom allow an alcoholic to live in our homes for\nlong at a time. It is not good for him, and it sometimes\ncreates serious complications in a family.\n\nThough an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason\nwhy you should neglect his family. You should continue\nto be friendly to them. The family should be offered\nyour way of life. Should they accept and practice\nspiritual principles, there is a much better chance that the\nhead of the family will recover. And even though he\ncontinues to drink, the family will find life more bearable.\nFor the type of alcoholic who is able and willing to\n\n\nget well, little charity, in the ordinary sense of the word,\nis needed or wanted. The men who cry for money and\nshelter before conquering alcohol, are on the wrong track.\nYet we do go to great extremes to provide each other with\nthese very things, when such action is warranted. This\nmay seem inconsistent, but we think it is not.\n\nIt is not the matter of giving that is in question, but\nwhen and how to give. That often makes the difference\nbetween failure and success. The minute we put our\nwork on a service plane, the alcoholic commences to rely\nupon our assistance rather than upon God. He clamors\nfor this or that, claiming he cannot master alcohol until\nhis material needs are cared for. Nonsense. Some of us\nhave taken very hard knocks to learn this truth: Job or no\njob—wife or no wife—we simply do not stop drinking\nso long as we place dependence upon other people ahead\nof dependence on God.\n\nBurn the idea into the consciousness of every man that\nhe can get well regardless of anyone. The only condition\nis that he trust in God and clean house.\n\nNow, the domestic problem: There may be divorce,\nseparation, or just strained relations. When your prospect\nhas made such reparation as he can to his family,\nand has thoroughly explained to them the new principles\nby which he is living, he should proceed to put\nthose principles into action at home. That is, if he is\nlucky enough to have a home. Though his family be at\nfault in many respects, he should not be concerned\nabout that. He should concentrate on his own spiritual\ndemonstration. Argument and fault-finding are to\nbe avoided like the plague. In many homes this is a\n\n\ndifficult thing to do, but it must be done if any results are\nto be expected. If persisted in for a few months, the\neffect on a man’s family is sure to be great. The most\nincompatible people discover they have a basis upon\nwhich they can meet. Little by little the family may see\ntheir own defects and admit them. These can then be\ndiscussed in an atmosphere of helpfulness and friendliness.\n\n\nAfter they have seen tangible results, the family will\nperhaps want to go along. These things will come to\npass naturally and in good time provided, however, the\nalcoholic continues to demonstrate that he can be sober,\nconsiderate, and helpful, regardless of what anyone says\nor does. Of course, we all fall much below this standard\nmany times. But we must try to repair the damage immediately\nlest we pay the penalty by a spree.\n\nIf there be divorce or separation, there should be no\nundue haste for the couple to get together. The man\nshould be sure of his recovery. The wife should fully\nunderstand his new way of life. If their old relationship\nis to be resumed it must be on a better basis, since the\nformer did not work. This means a new attitude and\nspirit all around. Sometimes it is to the best interest of all\nconcerned that a couple remain apart. Obviously, no rule\ncan be laid down. Let the alcoholic continue his program\nday by day. When the time for living together has come,\nit will be apparent to both parties.\n\nLet no alcoholic say he cannot recover unless he has\nhis family back. This just isn’t so. In some cases the\nwife will never come back for one reason or another.\nRemind the prospect that his recovery is not depend\n\n\n\nent upon people. It is dependent upon his relationship\nwith God. We have seen men get well whose families\nhave not returned at all. We have seen others slip when\nthe family came back too soon.\n\nBoth you and the new man must walk day by day in the\npath of spiritual progress. If you persist, remarkable\nthings will happen. When we look back, we realize that\nthe things which came to us when we put ourselves in\nGod’s hands were better than anything we could have\nplanned. Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you\nwill presently live in a new and wonderful world, no\nmatter what your present circumstances!\n\nWhen working with a man and his family, you should\ntake care not to participate in their quarrels. You may\nspoil your chance of being helpful if you do. But urge\nupon a man’s family that he has been a very sick person\nand should be treated accordingly. You should warn\nagainst arousing resentment or jealousy. You should point\nout that his defects of character are not going to disappear\nover night. Show them that he has entered upon a\nperiod of growth. Ask them to remember, when they are\nimpatient, the blessed fact of his sobriety.\n\nIf you have been successful in solving your own domestic\nproblems, tell the newcomer’s family how that was\naccomplished. In this way you can set them on the right\ntrack without becoming critical of them. The story of\nhow you and your wife settled your difficulties is worth\nany amount of criticism.\n\nAssuming we are spiritually fit, we can do all sorts of\nthings alcoholics are not supposed to do. People have\nsaid we must not go where liquor is served; we\n\n\nmust not have it in our homes; we must shun friends who\ndrink; we must avoid moving pictures which show drinking\nscenes; we must not go into bars; our friends must\nhide their bottles if we go to their houses; we mustn’t\nthink or be reminded about alcohol at all. Our experience\nshows that this is not necessarily so.\n\nWe meet these conditions every day. An alcoholic who\ncannot meet them, still has an alcoholic mind; there is\nsomething the matter with his spiritual status. His only\nchance for sobriety would be some place like the Greenland\nIce Cap, and even there an Eskimo might turn up with a\nbottle of scotch and ruin everything! Ask any woman\nwho has sent her husband to distant places on the theory\nhe would escape the alcohol problem.\n\nIn our belief any scheme of combating alcoholism which\nproposes to shield the sick man from temptation is doomed\nto failure. If the alcoholic tries to shield himself he may\nsucceed for a time, but he usually winds up with a bigger\nexplosion than ever. We have tried these methods. These\nattempts to do the impossible have always failed.\n\nSo our rule is not to avoid a place where there is drinking,\nif we have a legitimate reason for being there. That\nincludes bars, nightclubs, dances, receptions, weddings,\neven plain ordinary whoopee parties. To a person who\nhas had experience with an alcoholic, this may seem like\ntempting Providence, but it isn’t.\n\nYou will note that we made an important qualification.\nTherefore, ask yourself on each occasion, “Have\nI any good social, business, or personal reason for going\nto this place? Or am I expecting to steal a little\nvicarious pleasure from the atmosphere of such\n\n\nplaces?” If you answer these questions satisfactorily, you\nneed have no apprehension. Go or stay away, whichever\nseems best. But be sure you are on solid spiritual ground\nbefore you start and that your motive in going is thoroughly\ngood. Do not think of what you will get out of the\noccasion. Think of what you can bring to it. But if you are\nshaky, you had better work with another alcoholic instead!\n\nWhy sit with a long face in places where there is drinking,\nsighing about the good old days. If it is a happy occasion,\ntry to increase the pleasure of those there; if a business\noccasion, go and attend to your business enthusiastically.\nIf you are with a person who wants to eat in a bar, by all\nmeans go along. Let your friends know they are not to\nchange their habits on your account. At a proper time and\nplace explain to all your friends why alcohol disagrees\nwith you. If you do this thoroughly, few people will ask\nyou to drink. While you were drinking, you were withdrawing\nfrom life little by little. Now you are getting back\ninto the social life of this world. Don’t start to withdraw\nagain just because your friends drink liquor.\n\nYour job now is to be at the place where you may be of\nmaximum helpfulness to others, so never hesitate to go\nanywhere if you can be helpful. You should not hesitate\nto visit the most sordid spot on earth on such an errand.\nKeep on the firing line of life with these motives and God\nwill keep you unharmed.\n\nMany of us keep liquor in our homes. We often need\nit to carry green recruits through a severe hangover\nSome of us still serve it to our friends provided they\nare not alcoholic. But some of us think we should not\nserve liquor to anyone. We never argue this ques\n\n\n\ntion. We feel that each family, in the light of their own\ncircumstances, ought to decide for themselves.\n\nWe are careful never to show intolerance or hatred of\ndrinking as an institution. Experience shows that such an\nattitude is not helpful to anyone. Every new alcoholic\nlooks for this spirit among us and is immensely relieved\nwhen he finds we are not witch burners. A spirit of\nintolerance might repel alcoholics whose lives could have\nbeen saved, had it not been for such stupidity. We would\nnot even do the cause of temperate drinking any good, for\nnot one drinker in a thousand likes to be told anything\nabout alcohol by one who hates it.\n\nSome day we hope that Alcoholics Anonymous will\nhelp the public to a better realization of the gravity of the\nalcoholic problem, but we shall be of little use if our\nattitude is one of bitterness or hostility. Drinkers will\nnot stand for it.\n\nAfter all, our problems were of our own making. Bottles\nwere only a symbol. Besides, we have stopped fighting\nanybody or anything. We have to!\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n TO WIVES\n\nW\nW\nITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, our book thus far has\n\nspoken of men. But what we have said applies\n\nquite as much to women. Our activities in behalf of\n\nwomen who drink are on the increase. There is every\n\nevidence that women regain their health as readily as men\n\nif they try our suggestions.\n\nBut for every man who drinks others are involved—the\n\nwife who trembles in fear of the next debauch; the mother\n\nand father who see their son wasting away.\n\nAmong us are wives, relatives and friends whose prob\n\n\nlem has been solved, as well as some who have not yet\n\nfound a happy solution. We want the wives of Alcohol\n\n\nics Anonymous to address the wives of men who drink\n\ntoo much. What they say will apply to nearly everyone\n\nbound by ties of blood or affection to an alcoholic.\n\nAs wives of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like\n\nyou to feel that we understand as perhaps few can. We\n\nwant to analyze mistakes we have made. We want to\n\nleave you with the feeling that no situation is too difficult\n\nand no unhappiness too great to be overcome.\n\nWe have traveled a rocky road, there is no mistake\n\nabout that. We have had long rendezvous with hurt\n\npride, frustration, self-pity, misunderstanding and fear.\n\nThese are not pleasant companions. We have been\n\n\ndriven to maudlin sympathy, to bitter resentment.\nSome of us veered from extreme to extreme, ever hoping\nthat one day our loved ones would be themselves\nonce more.\n\nOur loyalty and the desire that our husbands hold up\ntheir heads and be like other men have begotten all\nsorts of predicaments. We have been unselfish and\nself-sacrificing. We have told innumerable lies to protect\nour pride and our husbands’reputations. We have\nprayed, we have begged, we have been patient. We\nhave struck out viciously. We have run away. We have\nbeen hysterical. We have been terror stricken. We\nhave sought sympathy. We have had retaliatory love\naffairs with other men.\n\nOur homes have been battle-grounds many an evening.\nIn the morning we have kissed and made up. Our friends\nhave counseled chucking the men and we have done so\nwith finality, only to be back in a little while hoping,\nalways hoping. Our men have sworn great solemn oaths\nthat they were through drinking forever. We have believed\nthem when no one else could or would. Then, in\ndays, weeks, or months, a fresh outburst.\n\nWe seldom had friends at our homes, never knowing\nhow or when the men of the house would appear. We\ncould make few social engagements. We came to live\nalmost alone. When we were invited out, our husbands\nsneaked so many drinks that they spoiled the\noccasion. If, on the other hand, they took nothing,\ntheir self-pity made them killjoys.\n\nThere was never financial security. Positions were\nalways in jeopardy or gone. An armored car could\n\n\nnot have brought the pay envelopes home. The checking\naccount melted like snow in June.\n\nSometimes there were other women. How heartbreaking\nwas this discovery; how cruel to be told they understood\nour men as we did not!\n\nThe bill collectors, the sheriffs, the angry taxi drivers,\nthe policemen, the bums, the pals, and even the ladies\nthey sometimes brought home—our husbands thought\nwe were so inhospitable. “Joykiller, nag, wet blanket”—\nthat’s what they said. Next day they would be themselves\nagain and we would forgive and try to forget.\n\nWe have tried to hold the love of our children for their\nfather. We have told small tots that father was sick,\nwhich was much nearer the truth than we realized. They\nstruck the children, kicked out door panels, smashed treasured\ncrockery, and ripped the keys out of pianos. In the\nmidst of such pandemonium they may have rushed out\nthreatening to live with the other woman forever. In\ndesperation, we have even got tight ourselves—the drunk\nto end all drunks. The unexpected result was that our\nhusbands seemed to like it.\n\nPerhaps at this point we got a divorce and took the\nchildren home to father and mother. Then we were severely\ncriticized by our husband’s parents for desertion.\nUsually we did not leave. We stayed on and on. We\nfinally sought employment ourselves as destitution faced\nus and our families.\n\nWe began to ask medical advice as the sprees got\ncloser together. The alarming physical and mental\nsymptoms, the deepening pall of remorse, depression\nand inferiority that settled down on our loved ones—\n\n\nthese things terrified and distracted us. As animals on a\ntreadmill, we have patiently and wearily climbed, falling\nback in exhaustion after each futile effort to reach solid\nground. Most of us have entered the final stage with its\ncommitment to health resorts, sanitariums, hospitals, and\njails. Sometimes there were screaming delirium and insanity.\nDeath was often near.\n\nUnder these conditions we naturally made mistakes.\nSome of them rose out of ignorance of alcoholism. Sometimes\nwe sensed dimly that we were dealing with sick\nmen. Had we fully understood the nature of the alcoholic\nillness, we might have behaved differently.\n\nHow could men who loved their wives and children be\nso unthinking, so callous, so cruel? There could be no\nlove in such persons, we thought. And just as we were\nbeing convinced of their heartlessness, they would surprise\nus with fresh resolves and new attentions. For a\nwhile they would be their old sweet selves, only to dash\nthe new structure of affection to pieces once more.\nAsked why they commenced to drink again, they would\nreply with some silly excuse, or none. It was so baffling,\nso heartbreaking. Could we have been so mistaken\nin the men we married? When drinking, they were\nstrangers. Sometimes they were so inaccessible that it\nseemed as though a great wall had been built around\nthem.\n\nAnd even if they did not love their families, how\ncould they be so blind about themselves? What had\nbecome of their judgment, their common sense, their\nwill power? Why could they not see that drink meant\nruin to them? Why was it, when these dangers were\n\n\npointed out that they agreed, and then got drunk again\nimmediately?\n\nThese are some of the questions which race through the\nmind of every woman who has an alcoholic husband. We\nhope this book has answered some of them. Perhaps your\nhusband has been living in that strange world of alcoholism\nwhere everything is distorted and exaggerated. You can see\nthat he really does love you with his better self. Of course,\nthere is such a thing as incompatibility, but in nearly every\ninstance the alcoholic only seems to be unloving and inconsiderate;\nit is usually because he is warped and sickened that\nhe says and does these appalling things. Today most of our\nmen are better husbands and fathers than ever before.\n\nTry not to condemn your alcoholic husband no matter\nwhat he says or does. He is just another very sick, unreasonable\nperson. Treat him, when you can, as though he\nhad pneumonia. When he angers you, remember that he is\nvery ill.\n\nThere is an important exception to the foregoing. We\nrealize some men are thoroughly bad-intentioned, that no\namount of patience will make any difference. An alcoholic\nof this temperament may be quick to use this chapter as a\nclub over your head. Don’t let him get away with it. If\nyou are positive he is one of this type you may feel you\nhad better leave. Is it right to let him ruin your life and the\nlives of your children? Especially when he has before him\na way to stop his drinking and abuse if he really wants to\npay the price.\n\nThe problem with which you struggle usually falls\nwithin one of four categories:\n\nOne: Your husband may be only a heavy drinker.\n\n\nHis drinking may be constant or it may be heavy only on\ncertain occasions. Perhaps he spends too much money\nfor liquor. It may be slowing him up mentally and physically,\nbut he does not see it. Sometimes he is a source of\nembarrassment to you and his friends. He is positive he\ncan handle his liquor, that it does him no harm, that drinking\nis necessary in his business. He would probably be\ninsulted if he were called an alcoholic. This world is full\nof people like him. Some will moderate or stop altogether,\nand some will not. Of those who keep on, a good\nnumber will become true alcoholics after a while.\n\nTwo: Your husband is showing lack of control, for he is\nunable to stay on the water wagon even when he wants\nto. He often gets entirely out of hand when drinking. He\nadmits this is true, but is positive that he will do better.\nHe has begun to try, with or without your cooperation,\nvarious means of moderating or staying dry. Maybe he is\nbeginning to lose his friends. His business may suffer\nsomewhat. He is worried at times, and is becoming aware\nthat he cannot drink like other people. He sometimes\ndrinks in the morning and through the day also, to hold\nhis nervousness in check. He is remorseful after serious\ndrinking bouts and tells you he wants to stop. But when\nhe gets over the spree, he begins to think once more how\nhe can drink moderately next time. We think this person\nis in danger. These are the earmarks of a real alcoholic.\nPerhaps he can still tend to business fairly well. He has\nby no means ruined everything. As we say among ourselves,\n“He wants to want to stop.”\n\nThree: This husband has gone much further than\nhusband number two. Though once like number two\n\n\nhe became worse. His friends have slipped away, his\nhome is a near-wreck and he cannot hold a position.\nMaybe the doctor has been called in, and the weary round\nof sanitariums and hospitals has begun. He admits he\ncannot drink like other people, but does not see why. He\nclings to the notion that he will yet find a way to do so.\nHe may have come to the point where he desperately\nwants to stop but cannot. His case presents additional\nquestions which we shall try to answer for you. You can\nbe quite hopeful of a situation like this.\n\nFour: You may have a husband of whom you completely\ndespair. He has been placed in one institution\nafter another. He is violent, or appears definitely insane\nwhen drunk. Sometimes he drinks on the way home from\nthe hospital. Perhaps he has had delirium tremens. Doctors\nmay shake their heads and advise you to have him\ncommitted. Maybe you have already been obliged to put\nhim away. This picture may not be as dark as it looks.\nMany of our husbands were just as far gone. Yet they\ngot well.\n\nLet’s now go back to husband number one. Oddly\nenough, he is often difficult to deal with. He enjoys\ndrinking. It stirs his imagination. His friends feel closer\nover a highball. Perhaps you enjoy drinking with him\nyourself when he doesn’t go too far. You have passed\nhappy evenings together chatting and drinking before your\nfire. Perhaps you both like parties which would be dull\nwithout liquor. We have enjoyed such evenings ourselves;\nwe had a good time. We know all about liquor as a social\nlubricant. Some, but not all of us, think it has its advantages\nwhen reasonably used.\n\n\nThe first principle of success is that you should never\nbe angry. Even though your husband becomes unbearable\nand you have to leave him temporarily, you should,\nif you can, go without rancor. Patience and good temper\nare most necessary.\n\nOur next thought is that you should never tell him\nwhat he must do about his drinking. If he gets the idea\nthat you are a nag or killjoy, your chance of accomplishing\nanything useful may be zero. He will use that as an\nexcuse to drink more. He will tell you he is misunderstood.\nThis may lead to lonely evenings for you. He\nmay seek someone else to console him—not always\nanother man.\n\nBe determined that your husband’s drinking is not going\nto spoil your relations with your children or your\nfriends. They need your companionship and your help.\nIt is possible to have a full and useful life, though your\nhusband continues to drink. We know women who are\nunafraid, even happy under these conditions. Do not set\nyour heart on reforming your husband. You may be unable\nto do so, no matter how hard you try.\n\nWe know these suggestions are sometimes difficult to\nfollow, but you will save many a heartbreak if you can\nsucceed in observing them. Your husband may come to\nappreciate your reasonableness and patience. This may\nlay the groundwork for a friendly talk about his alcoholic\nproblem. Try to have him bring up the subject himself.\nBe sure you are not critical during such a discussion.\nAttempt instead, to put yourself in his place. Let him\nsee that you want to be helpful rather than critical.\n\nWhen a discussion does arise, you might suggest he\n\n\nread this book or at least the chapter on alcoholism. Tell him\nyou have been worried, though perhaps needlessly. You\nthink he ought to know the subject better, as everyone should\nhave a clear understanding of the risk he takes if he drinks\ntoo much. Show him you have confidence in his power to\nstop or moderate. Say you do not want to be a wet blanket;\nthat you only want him to take care of his health. Thus you\nmay succeed in interesting him in alcoholism.\n\nHe probably has several alcoholics among his own acquaintances.\nYou might suggest that you both take an\ninterest in them. Drinkers like to help other drinkers.\nYour husband may be willing to talk to one of them.\n\nIf this kind of approach does not catch your husband’s\ninterest, it may be best to drop the subject, but after a\nfriendly talk your husband will usually revive the topic\nhimself. This may take patient waiting, but it will be\nworth it. Meanwhile you might try to help the wife of\nanother serious drinker. If you act upon these principles,\nyour husband may stop or moderate.\n\nSuppose, however, that your husband fits the description\nof number two. The same principles which apply to\nhusband number one should be practiced. But after his\nnext binge, ask him if he would really like to get over\ndrinking for good. Do not ask that he do it for you or\nanyone else. Just would he like to?\n\nThe chances are he would. Show him your copy of\nthis book and tell him what you have found out about\nalcoholism. Show him that as alcoholics, the writers of\nthe book understand. Tell him some of the interesting\nstories you have read. If you think he will be shy of a\nspiritual remedy, ask him to look at the chapter on\n\n\nalcoholism. Then perhaps he will be interested enough\nto continue.\n\nIf he is enthusiastic your cooperation will mean a great\ndeal. If he is lukewarm or thinks he is not an alcoholic,\nwe suggest you leave him alone. Avoid urging him to\nfollow our program. The seed has been planted in his\nmind. He knows that thousands of men, much like himself,\nhave recovered. But don’t remind him of this after\nhe had been drinking, for he may be angry. Sooner or\nlater, you are likely to find him reading the book once\nmore. Wait until repeated stumbling convinces him he\nmust act, for the more you hurry him the longer his recovery\nmay be delayed.\n\nIf you have a number three husband, you may be in luck.\nBeing certain he wants to stop, you can go to him with this\nvolume as joyfully as though you had struck oil. He may\nnot share your enthusiasm, but he is practically sure to\nread the book and he may go for the program at once. If he\ndoes not, you will probably not have long to wait. Again,\nyou should not crowd him. Let him decide for himself.\nCheerfully see him through more sprees. Talk about his\ncondition or this book only when he raises the issue. In\nsome cases it may be better to let someone outside the\nfamily present the book. They can urge action without\narousing hostility. If your husband is otherwise a normal\nindividual, your chances are good at this stage.\n\nYou would suppose that men in the fourth classification\nwould be quite hopeless, but that is not so. Many of\nAlcoholics Anonymous were like that. Everybody had\ngiven them up. Defeat seemed certain. Yet often such\nmen had spectacular and powerful recoveries.\n\n\nThere are exceptions. Some men have been so impaired\nby alcohol that they cannot stop. Sometimes there are\ncases where alcoholism is complicated by other disorders.\nA good doctor or psychiatrist can tell you whether these\ncomplications are serious. In any event, try to have your\nhusband read this book. His reaction may be one of enthusiasm.\nIf he is already committed to an institution, but can\nconvince you and your doctor that he means business, give\nhim a chance to try our method, unless the doctor thinks\nhis mental condition too abnormal or dangerous. We make\nthis recommendation with some confidence. For years we\nhave been working with alcoholics committed to institutions.\nSince this book was first published, A.A. has released\nthousands of alcoholics from asylums and hospitals\nof every kind. The majority have never returned. The\npower of God goes deep!\n\nYou may have the reverse situation on your hands. Perhaps\nyou have a husband who is at large, but who should be\ncommitted. Some men cannot or will not get over alcoholism.\nWhen they become too dangerous, we think the kind\nthing is to lock them up, but of course a good doctor should\nalways be consulted. The wives and children of such men\nsuffer horribly, but not more than the men themselves.\n\nBut sometimes you must start life anew. We know\nwomen who have done it. If such women adopt a spiritual\nway of life their road will be smoother.\n\nIf your husband is a drinker, you probably worry\nover what other people are thinking and you hate to\nmeet your friends. You draw more and more into yourself\nand you think everyone is talking about conditions\nat your home. You avoid the subject of drink\n\n\n\ning, even with your own parents. You do not know what\nto tell the children. When your husband is bad, you\nbecome a trembling recluse, wishing the telephone had\nnever been invented.\n\nWe find that most of this embarrassment is unnecessary.\nWhile you need not discuss your husband at length,\nyou can quietly let your friends know the nature of his\nillness. But you must be on guard not to embarrass or\nharm your husband.\n\nWhen you have carefully explained to such people that\nhe is a sick person, you will have created a new atmosphere.\nBarriers which have sprung up between you and\nyour friends will disappear with the growth of sympathetic\nunderstanding. You will no longer be self-conscious\nor feel that you must apologize as though your\nhusband were a weak character. He may be anything but\nthat. Your new courage, good nature and lack of self-\nconsciousness will do wonders for you socially.\n\nThe same principle applies in dealing with the children.\nUnless they actually need protection from their father, it\nis best not to take sides in any argument he has with them\nwhile drinking. Use your energies to promote a better\nunderstanding all around. Then that terrible tension which\ngrips the home of every problem drinker will be lessened.\nFrequently, you have felt obliged to tell your husband’s\nemployer and his friends that he was sick, when as a\nmatter of fact he was tight. Avoid answering these inquiries\nas much as you can. Whenever possible, let\nyour husband explain. Your desire to protect him should\nnot cause you to lie to people when they have a right to\nknow where he is and what he is doing. Dis\n\n\n\ncuss this with him when he is sober and in good spirits.\nAsk him what you should do if he places you in such a\nposition again. But be careful not to be resentful about\nthe last time he did so.\n\nThere is another paralyzing fear. You may be afraid your\nhusband will lose his position; you are thinking of the disgrace\nand hard times which will befall you and the children.\nThis experience may come to you. Or you may already\nhave had it several times. Should it happen again, regard it in\na different light. Maybe it will prove a blessing! It may\nconvince your husband he wants to stop drinking forever.\nAnd now you know that he can stop if he will! Time after\ntime, this apparent calamity has been a boon to us, for it\nopened up a path which led to the discovery of God.\n\nWe have elsewhere remarked how much better life is\nwhen lived on a spiritual plane. If God can solve the age-\nold riddle of alcoholism, He can solve your problems too.\nWe wives found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted\nwith pride, self-pity, vanity and all the things\nwhich go to make up the self-centered person; and we\nwere not above selfishness or dishonesty. As our husbands\nbegan to apply spiritual principles in their lives,\nwe began to see the desirability of doing so too.\n\nAt first, some of us did not believe we needed this\nhelp. We thought, on the whole, we were pretty good\nwomen, capable of being nicer if our husbands stopped\ndrinking. But it was a silly idea that we were too good\nto need God. Now we try to put spiritual principles to\nwork in every department of our lives. When we do\nthat, we find it solves our problems too; the ensuing\nlack of fear, worry and hurt feelings is a wonderful\n\n\nthing. We urge you to try our program, for nothing will\nbe so helpful to your husband as the radically changed\nattitude toward him which God will show you how to\nhave. Go along with your husband if you possibly can.\n\nIf you and your husband find a solution for the pressing\nproblem of drink you are, of course, going to be very\nhappy. But all problems will not be solved at once. Seed\nhas started to sprout in a new soil, but growth has only\nbegun. In spite of your new-found happiness, there will\nbe ups and downs. Many of the old problems will still\nbe with you. This is as it should be.\n\nThe faith and sincerity of both you and your husband\nwill be put to the test. These work-outs should be regarded\nas part of your education, for thus you will be\nlearning to live. You will make mistakes, but if you are in\nearnest they will not drag you down. Instead, you will\ncapitalize them. A better way of life will emerge when\nthey are overcome.\n\nSome of the snags you will encounter are irritation,\nhurt feelings and resentments. Your husband\nwill sometimes be unreasonable and you will want\nto criticize. Starting from a speck on the domestic\nhorizon, great thunderclouds of dispute may gather.\nThese family dissensions are very dangerous, especially\nto your husband. Often you must carry\nthe burden of avoiding them or keeping them under\ncontrol. Never forget that resentment is a deadly\nhazard to an alcoholic. We do not mean that you\nhave to agree with your husband whenever there is\nan honest difference of opinion. Just be careful\nnot to disagree in a resentful or critical spirit.\n\n\nYou and your husband will find that you can dispose of\nserious problems easier than you can the trivial ones. Next\ntime you and he have a heated discussion, no matter what\nthe subject, it should be the privilege of either to smile and\nsay, “This is getting serious. I’m sorry I got disturbed.\nLet’s talk about it later.” If your husband is trying to live\non a spiritual basis, he will also be doing everything in his\npower to avoid disagreement or contention.\n\nYour husband knows he owes you more than sobriety.\nHe wants to make good. Yet you must not expect too\nmuch. His ways of thinking and doing are the habits of\nyears. Patience, tolerance, understanding and love are the\nwatchwords. Show him these things in yourself and they\nwill be reflected back to you from him. Live and let live is\nthe rule. If you both show a willingness to remedy your\nown defects, there will be little need to criticize each other.\n\nWe women carry with us a picture of the ideal man, the\nsort of chap we would like our husbands to be. It is the\nmost natural thing in the world, once his liquor problem\nis solved, to feel that he will now measure up to that\ncherished vision. The chances are he will not for, like\nyourself, he is just beginning his development. Be patient.\n\n\nAnother feeling we are very likely to entertain is one\nof resentment that love and loyalty could not cure our\nhusbands of alcoholism. We do not like the thought\nthat the contents of a book or the work of another\nalcoholic has accomplished in a few weeks that for\nwhich we struggled for years. At such moments we\nforget that alcoholism is an illness over which we could\nnot possibly have had any power. Your husband will\n\n\nbe the first to say it was your devotion and care which\nbrought him to the point where he could have a spiritual\nexperience. Without you he would have gone to pieces\nlong ago. When resentful thoughts come, try to pause and\ncount your blessings. After all, your family is reunited,\nalcohol is no longer a problem and you and your husband\nare working together toward an undreamed-of future.\n\nStill another difficulty is that you may become jealous\nof the attention he bestows on other people, especially\nalcoholics. You have been starving for his companionship,\nyet he spends long hours helping other men and\ntheir families. You feel he should now be yours. The fact\nis that he should work with other people to maintain his\nown sobriety. Sometimes he will be so interested that he\nbecomes really neglectful. Your house is filled with strangers.\nYou may not like some of them. He gets stirred up\nabout their troubles, but not at all about yours. It will do\nlittle good if you point that out and urge more attention\nfor yourself. We find it a real mistake to dampen his\nenthusiasm for alcoholic work. You should join in his\nefforts as much as you possibly can. We suggest that\nyou direct some of your thought to the wives of his new\nalcoholic friends. They need the counsel and love of a\nwoman who has gone through what you have.\n\nIt is probably true that you and your husband have\nbeen living too much alone, for drinking many times\nisolates the wife of an alcoholic. Therefore, you probably\nneed fresh interests and a great cause to live for as\nmuch as your husband. If you cooperate, rather than\ncomplain, you will find that his excess enthusiasm will\ntone down. Both of you will awaken to a new\n\n\nsense of responsibility for others. You, as well as your\nhusband, ought to think of what you can put into life\ninstead of how much you can take out. Inevitably your\nlives will be fuller for doing so. You will lose the old life\nto find one much better.\n\nPerhaps your husband will make a fair start on the new\nbasis, but just as things are going beautifully he dismays\nyou by coming home drunk. If you are satisfied he really\nwants to get over drinking, you need not be alarmed.\nThough it is infinitely better that he have no relapse at\nall, as has been true with many of our men, it is by no\nmeans a bad thing in some cases. Your husband will see\nat once that he must redouble his spiritual activities if he\nexpects to survive. You need not remind him of his spiritual\ndeficiency—he will know of it. Cheer him up and\nask him how you can be still more helpful.\n\nThe slightest sign of fear or intolerance may lessen your\nhusband’s chance of recovery. In a weak moment he may\ntake your dislike of his high-stepping friends as one of\nthose insanely trivial excuses to drink.\n\nWe never, never try to arrange a man’s life so as to\nshield him from temptation. The slightest disposition on\nyour part to guide his appointments or his affairs so he\nwill not be tempted will be noticed. Make him feel absolutely\nfree to come and go as he likes. This is important.\nIf he gets drunk, don’t blame yourself. God has either\nremoved your husband’s liquor problem or He has not.\nIf not, it had better be found out right away. Then you\nand your husband can get right down to fundamentals. If\na repetition is to be prevented, place the problem, along\nwith everything else, in God’s hands.\n\n\nWe realize that we have been giving you much direction\nand advice. We may have seemed to lecture. If that is so\nwe are sorry, for we ourselves don’t always care for people\nwho lecture us. But what we have related is based upon\nexperience, some of it painful. We had to learn these\nthings the hard way. That is why we are anxious that\nyou understand, and that you avoid these unnecessary\ndifficulties.\n\nSo to you out there—who may soon be with us—we\nsay “Good luck and God bless you!”\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nTHE FAMILY AFTERWARD\n\nO\nO\nUR WOMEN FOLK have suggested certain attitudes\na wife may take with the husband who is recovering.\nPerhaps they created the impression that he is to be\nwrapped in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal. Successful\nreadjustment means the opposite. All members\nof the family should meet upon the common ground of\ntolerance, understanding and love. This involves a process\nof deflation. The alcoholic, his wife, his children, his\n“in-laws,” each one is likely to have fixed ideas about the\nfamily’s attitude towards himself or herself. Each is interested\nin having his or her wishes respected. We find\nthe more one member of the family demands that the\nothers concede to him, the more resentful they become.\nThis makes for discord and unhappiness.\n\nAnd why? Is it not because each wants to play the\nlead? Is not each trying to arrange the family show to his\nliking? Is he not unconsciously trying to see what he can\ntake from the family life rather than give?\n\nCessation of drinking is but the first step away from\na highly strained, abnormal condition. A doctor said to\nus, “Years of living with an alcoholic is almost sure to\nmake any wife or child neurotic. The entire family is,\nto some extent, ill.” Let families realize, as they start\ntheir journey, that all will not be fair weather. Each in\nhis turn may be footsore and may straggle.\n\n\nThere will be alluring shortcuts and by-paths down which\nthey may wander and lose their way.\n\nSuppose we tell you some of the obstacles a family will\nmeet; suppose we suggest how they may be avoided—\neven converted to good use for others. The family of an\nalcoholic longs for the return of happiness and security.\nThey remember when father was romantic, thoughtful and\nsuccessful. Today’s life is measured against that of other\nyears and, when it falls short, the family may be unhappy.\n\nFamily confidence in dad is rising high. The good old\ndays will soon be back, they think. Sometimes they\ndemand that dad bring them back instantly! God, they\nbelieve, almost owes this recompense on a long overdue\naccount. But the head of the house has spent years in\npulling down the structures of business, romance, friendship,\nhealth—these things are now ruined or damaged. It\nwill take time to clear away the wreck. Though old buildings\nwill eventually be replaced by finer ones, the new\nstructures will take years to complete.\n\nFather knows he is to blame; it may take him many\nseasons of hard work to be restored financially, but he\nshouldn’t be reproached. Perhaps he will never have\nmuch money again. But the wise family will admire him\nfor what he is trying to be, rather than for what he is\ntrying to get.\n\nNow and then the family will be plagued by spectres\nfrom the past, for the drinking career of almost every\nalcoholic has been marked by escapades, funny, humiliating,\nshameful or tragic. The first impulse will be to\nbury these skeletons in a dark closet and padlock the\ndoor. The family may be possessed by the idea\n\n\nthat future happiness can be based only upon forgetfulness\nof the past. We think that such a view is self-\ncentered and in direct conflict with the new way of living.\n\nHenry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect that\nexperience is the thing of supreme value in life.1 That is\ntrue only if one is willing to turn the past to good account.\nWe grow by our willingness to face and rectify\nerrors and convert them into assets. The alcoholic’s past\nthus becomes the principal asset of the family and frequently\nit is almost the only one!\n\nThis painful past may be of infinite value to other families\nstill struggling with their problem. We think each\nfamily which has been relieved owes something to those\nwho have not, and when the occasion requires, each member\nof it should be only too willing to bring former mistakes,\nno matter how grievous, out of their hiding places.\nShowing others who suffer how we were given help is\nthe very thing which makes life seem so worth while to\nus now. Cling to the thought that, in God’s hands, the\ndark past is the greatest possession you have—the key\nto life and happiness for others. With it you can avert\ndeath and misery for them.\n\nIt is possible to dig up past misdeeds so they become\na blight, a veritable plague. For example, we know of\nsituations in which the alcoholic or his wife have had\nlove affairs. In the first flush of spiritual experience\nthey forgave each other and drew closer together. The\nmiracle of reconciliation was at hand. Then, under one\nprovocation or another, the aggrieved one would unearth\nthe old affair and angrily cast its ashes about. A\nfew of us have had these growing pains and they\n\n\nhurt a great deal. Husbands and wives have sometimes\nbeen obliged to separate for a time until new perspective,\nnew victory over hurt pride could be re-won. In most\ncases, the alcoholic survived this ordeal without relapse,\nbut not always. So we think that unless some good and\nuseful purpose is to be served, past occurrences should\nnot be discussed.\n\nWe families of Alcoholics Anonymous keep few skeletons\nin the closet. Everyone knows about the others’\nalcoholic troubles. This is a condition which, in ordinary\nlife, would produce untold grief; there might be scandalous\ngossip, laughter at the expense of other people, and a\ntendency to take advantage of intimate information.\nAmong us, these are rare occurrences. We do talk about\neach other a great deal, but we almost invariably temper\nsuch talk by a spirit of love and tolerance.\n\nAnother principle we observe carefully is that we do\nnot relate intimate experiences of another person unless\nwe are sure he would approve. We find it better, when\npossible, to stick to our own stories. A man may criticize\nor laugh at himself and it will affect others favorably,\nbut criticism or ridicule coming from another often produces\nthe contrary effect. Members of a family should\nwatch such matters carefully, for one careless, inconsiderate\nremark has been known to raise the very devil. We\nalcoholics are sensitive people. It takes some of us a long\ntime to outgrow that serious handicap.\n\nMany alcoholics are enthusiasts. They run to extremes.\nAt the beginning of recovery a man will take,\nas a rule, one of two directions. He may either plunge\ninto a frantic attempt to get on his feet in business, or\n\n\nhe may be so enthralled by his new life that he talks or\nthinks of little else. In either case certain family problems\nwill arise. With these we have had experience galore.\n\n\nWe think it dangerous if he rushes headlong at his economic\nproblem. The family will be affected also, pleasantly\nat first, as they feel their money troubles are about\nto be solved, then not so pleasantly as they find themselves\nneglected. Dad may be tired at night and preoccupied\nby day. He may take small interest in the children\nand may show irritation when reproved for his delinquencies.\nIf not irritable, he may seem dull and boring,\nnot gay and affectionate as the family would like him to\nbe. Mother may complain of inattention. They are all\ndisappointed, and often let him feel it. Beginning with\nsuch complaints, a barrier arises. He is straining every\nnerve to make up for lost time. He is striving to recover\nfortune and reputation and feels he is doing very well.\n\nSometimes mother and children don’t think so. Having\nbeen neglected and misused in the past, they think father\nowes them more than they are getting. They want him to\nmake a fuss over them. They expect him to give them the\nnice times they used to have before he drank so much, and to\nshow his contrition for what they suffered. But dad doesn’t\ngive freely of himself. Resentment grows. He becomes still\nless communicative. Sometimes he explodes over a trifle.\nThe family is mystified. They criticize, pointing out how\nhe is falling down on his spiritual program.\n\nThis sort of thing can be avoided. Both father and\nthe family are mistaken, though each side may have\nsome justification. It is of little use to argue and only\n\n\nmakes the impasse worse. The family must realize that\ndad, though marvelously improved, is still convalescing.\nThey should be thankful he is sober and able to be of this\nworld once more. Let them praise his progress. Let them\nremember that his drinking wrought all kinds of damage\nthat may take long to repair. If they sense these things,\nthey will not take so seriously his periods of crankiness,\ndepression, or apathy, which will disappear when there\nis tolerance, love, and spiritual understanding.\n\nThe head of the house ought to remember that he is\nmainly to blame for what befell his home. He can scarcely\nsquare the account in his lifetime. But he must see the\ndanger of over-concentration on financial success. Although\nfinancial recovery is on the way for many of us,\nwe found we could not place money first. For us, material\nwell-being always followed spiritual progress; it never\npreceded.\n\nSince the home has suffered more than anything else,\nit is well that a man exert himself there. He is not likely\nto get far in any direction if he fails to show unselfishness\nand love under his own roof. We know there are\ndifficult wives and families, but the man who is getting\nover alcoholism must remember he did much to make\nthem so.\n\nAs each member of a resentful family begins to see\nhis shortcomings and admits them to the others, he\nlays a basis for helpful discussion. These family talks\nwill be constructive if they can be carried on without\nheated argument, self-pity, self-justification or resentful\ncriticism. Little by little, mother and children will\nsee they ask too much, and father will see he gives too\n\n\nlittle. Giving, rather than getting, will become the guiding\nprinciple.\n\nAssume on the other hand that father has, at the outset,\na stirring spiritual experience. Overnight, as it were, he is\na different man. He becomes a religious enthusiast. He is\nunable to focus on anything else. As soon as his sobriety\nbegins to be taken as a matter of course, the family may\nlook at their strange new dad with apprehension, then\nwith irritation. There is talk about spiritual matters morning,\nnoon and night. He may demand that the family find\nGod in a hurry, or exhibit amazing indifference to them\nand say he is above worldly considerations. He may tell\nmother, who has been religious all her life, that she doesn’t\nknow what it’s all about, and that she had better get his\nbrand of spirituality while there is yet time.\n\nWhen father takes this tack, the family may react unfavorably.\nThey may be jealous of a God who has stolen\ndad’s affections. While grateful that he drinks no more,\nthey may not like the idea that God has accomplished the\nmiracle where they failed. They often forget father was\nbeyond human aid. They may not see why their love and\ndevotion did not straighten him out. Dad is not so spiritual\nafter all, they say. If he means to right his past\nwrongs, why all this concern for everyone in the world\nbut his family? What about his talk that God will take\ncare of them? They suspect father is a bit balmy!\n\nHe is not so unbalanced as they might think. Many\nof us have experienced dad’s elation. We have indulged\nin spiritual intoxication. Like a gaunt prospector,\nbelt drawn in over the last ounce of food, our\npick struck gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of\n\n\nfrustration knew no bounds. Father feels he has struck\nsomething better than gold. For a time he may try to hug\nthe new treasure to himself. He may not see at once that\nhe has barely scratched a limitless lode which will pay\ndividends only if he mines it for the rest of his life and\ninsists on giving away the entire product.\n\nIf the family cooperates, dad will soon see that he is\nsuffering from a distortion of values. He will perceive\nthat his spiritual growth is lopsided, that for an average\nman like himself, a spiritual life which does not\ninclude his family obligations may not be so perfect\nafter all. If the family will appreciate that dad’s current\nbehavior is but a phase of his development, all\nwill be well. In the midst of an understanding and\nsympathetic family, these vagaries of dad’s spiritual\ninfancy will quickly disappear.\n\nThe opposite may happen should the family condemn\nand criticize. Dad may feel that for years his drinking has\nplaced him on the wrong side of every argument, but that\nnow he has become a superior person with God on his\nside. If the family persists in criticism, this fallacy may\ntake a still greater hold on father. Instead of treating the\nfamily as he should, he may retreat further into himself\nand feel he has spiritual justification for so doing.\n\nThough the family does not fully agree with dad’s\nspiritual activities, they should let him have his head.\nEven if he displays a certain amount of neglect and\nirresponsibility towards the family, it is well to let\nhim go as far as he likes in helping other alcoholics.\nDuring those first days of convalescence, this will do\nmore to insure his sobriety than anything else. Though\n\n\nsome of his manifestations are alarming and disagreeable,\nwe think dad will be on a firmer foundation than the man\nwho is placing business or professional success ahead of\nspiritual development. He will be less likely to drink\nagain, and anything is preferable to that.\n\nThose of us who have spent much time in the world of\nspiritual make-believe have eventually seen the childishness\nof it. This dream world has been replaced by a great\nsense of purpose, accompanied by a growing consciousness\nof the power of God in our lives. We have come to\nbelieve He would like us to keep our heads in the clouds\nwith Him, but that our feet ought to be firmly planted on\nearth. That is where our fellow travelers are, and that is\nwhere our work must be done. These are the realities for\nus. We have found nothing incompatible between a powerful\nspiritual experience and a life of sane and happy\nusefulness.\n\nOne more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual\nconvictions or not, they may do well to examine the principles\nby which the alcoholic member is trying to live.\nThey can hardly fail to approve these simple principles,\nthough the head of the house still fails somewhat in practicing\nthem. Nothing will help the man who is off on a\nspiritual tangent so much as the wife who adopts a sane\nspiritual program, making a better practical use of it.\n\nThere will be other profound changes in the household.\nLiquor incapacitated father for so many years\nthat mother became head of the house. She met these\nresponsibilities gallantly. By force of circumstances,\nshe was often obliged to treat father as a sick or wayward\nchild. Even when he wanted to assert himself\n\n\nhe could not, for his drinking placed him constantly in\nthe wrong. Mother made all the plans and gave the directions.\nWhen sober, father usually obeyed. Thus mother,\nthrough no fault of her own, became accustomed to wearing\nthe family trousers. Father, coming suddenly to life\nagain, often begins to assert himself. This means trouble,\nunless the family watches for these tendencies in each\nother and comes to a friendly agreement about them.\n\nDrinking isolates most homes from the outside world.\nFather may have laid aside for years all normal activities—\nclubs, civic duties, sports. When he renews interest in\nsuch things, a feeling of jealousy may arise. The family\nmay feel they hold a mortgage on dad, so big that no equity\nshould be left for outsiders. Instead of developing new\nchannels of activity for themselves, mother and children\ndemand that he stay home and make up the deficiency.\n\nAt the very beginning, the couple ought to frankly face\nthe fact that each will have to yield here and there if the\nfamily is going to play an effective part in the new life.\nFather will necessarily spend much time with other alcoholics,\nbut this activity should be balanced. New acquaintances\nwho know nothing of alcoholism might be\nmade and thoughtful consideration given their needs. The\nproblems of the community might engage attention.\nThough the family has no religious connections, they\nmay wish to make contact with or take membership in a\nreligious body.\n\nAlcoholics who have derided religious people will\nbe helped by such contacts. Being possessed of a\nspiritual experience, the alcoholic will find he has\nmuch in common with these people, though he may\n\n\ndiffer with them on many matters. If he does not argue\nabout religion, he will make new friends and is sure to\nfind new avenues of usefulness and pleasure. He and his\nfamily can be a bright spot in such congregations. He\nmay bring new hope and new courage to many a priest,\nminister, or rabbi, who gives his all to minister to our\ntroubled world. We intend the foregoing as a helpful\nsuggestion only. So far as we are concerned, there is\nnothing obligatory about it. As non-denominational\npeople, we cannot make up others’ minds for them. Each\nindividual should consult his own conscience.\n\nWe have been speaking to you of serious, sometimes\ntragic things. We have been dealing with alcohol in its\nworst aspect. But we aren’t a glum lot. If newcomers\ncould see no joy or fun in our existence, they wouldn’t\nwant it. We absolutely insist on enjoying life. We try not\nto indulge in cynicism over the state of the nations, nor\ndo we carry the world’s troubles on our shoulders. When\nwe see a man sinking into the mire that is alcoholism, we\ngive him first aid and place what we have at his disposal.\nFor his sake, we do recount and almost relive the horrors\nof our past. But those of us who have tried to shoulder\nthe entire burden and trouble of others find we are soon\novercome by them.\n\nSo we think cheerfulness and laughter make for usefulness.\nOutsiders are sometimes shocked when we burst\ninto merriment over a seemingly tragic experience out of\nthe past. But why shouldn’t we laugh? We have recovered,\nand have been given the power to help others.\n\nEverybody knows that those in bad health, and those\nwho seldom play, do not laugh much. So let\n\n\neach family play together or separately, as much as their\ncircumstances warrant. We are sure God wants us to be\nhappy, joyous, and free. We cannot subscribe to the\nbelief that this life is a vale of tears, though it once was\njust that for many of us. But it is clear that we made our\nown misery. God didn’t do it. Avoid then, the deliberate\nmanufacture of misery, but if trouble comes, cheerfully\ncapitalize it as an opportunity to demonstrate His omnipotence.\n\n\nNow about health: A body badly burned by alcohol\ndoes not often recover overnight nor do twisted thinking\nand depression vanish in a twinkling. We are convinced\nthat a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful health\nrestorative. We, who have recovered from serious drinking,\nare miracles of mental health. But we have seen\nremarkable transformations in our bodies. Hardly one of\nour crowd now shows any mark of dissipation.\n\nBut this does not mean that we disregard human health\nmeasures. God has abundantly supplied this world with\nfine doctors, psychologists, and practitioners of various\nkinds. Do not hesitate to take your health problems to\nsuch persons. Most of them give freely of themselves,\nthat their fellows may enjoy sound minds and bodies.\nTry to remember that though God has wrought miracles\namong us, we should never belittle a good doctor or psychiatrist.\nTheir services are often indispensable in treating\na newcomer and in following his case afterward.\n\nOne of the many doctors who had the opportunity\nof reading this book in manuscript form told us that\nthe use of sweets was often helpful, of course depending\nupon a doctor’s advice. He thought all alcoholics\n\n\nshould constantly have chocolate available for its quick\nenergy value at times of fatigue. He added that occasionally\nin the night a vague craving arose which would\nbe satisfied by candy. Many of us have noticed a\ntendency to eat sweets and have found this practice\nbeneficial.\n\nA word about sex relations. Alcohol is so sexually\nstimulating to some men that they have over-indulged.\nCouples are occasionally dismayed to find that when\ndrinking is stopped the man tends to be impotent. Unless\nthe reason is understood, there may be an emotional\nupset. Some of us had this experience, only to enjoy, in\na few months, a finer intimacy than ever. There should\nbe no hesitancy in consulting a doctor or psychologist if\nthe condition persists. We do not know of many cases\nwhere this difficulty lasted long.\n\nThe alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish friendly\nrelations with his children. Their young minds were impressionable\nwhile he was drinking. Without saying so,\nthey may cordially hate him for what he has done to\nthem and to their mother. The children are sometimes\ndominated by a pathetic hardness and cynicism. They\ncannot seem to forgive and forget. This may hang on for\nmonths, long after their mother has accepted dad’s new\nway of living and thinking.\n\nIn time they will see that he is a new man and in their\nown way they will let him know it. When this happens,\nthey can be invited to join in morning meditation and\nthen they can take part in the daily discussion without\nrancor or bias. From that point on, progress will be\nrapid. Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.\n\n\nWhether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the\nalcoholic member has to if he would recover. The others\nmust be convinced of his new status beyond the shadow\nof a doubt. Seeing is believing to most families who have\nlived with a drinker.\n\nHere is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy\nsmoker and coffee drinker. There was no doubt he overindulged.\nSeeing this, and meaning to be helpful, his wife\ncommenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he\nwas overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was\nnot ready to stop. His wife is one of those persons who\nreally feels there is something rather sinful about these\ncommodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally\nthrew him into a fit of anger. He got drunk.\n\nOf course our friend was wrong—dead wrong. He had\nto painfully admit that and mend his spiritual fences.\nThough he is now a most effective member of Alcoholics\nAnonymous, he still smokes and drinks coffee, but neither\nhis wife nor anyone else stands in judgment. She\nsees she was wrong to make a burning issue out of such a\nmatter when his more serious ailments were being rapidly\ncured.\n\nWe have three little mottoes which are apropos. Here\nthey are:\n\nFirst Things First\n\n Live and Let Live\n\n Easy Does It.\n\nNote\n\n1 Henry Ford: A pioneer of automated production, became widely\nknown and very wealthy from manufacturing automobiles.\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nTO EMPLOYERS\n\nA\nA\nMONG MANY employers nowadays, we think of\none member who has spent much of his life in the\nworld of big business. He has hired and fired hundreds of\nmen. He knows the alcoholic as the employer sees him.\nHis present views ought to prove exceptionally useful to\nbusiness men everywhere.\nBut let him tell you:\n\nI was at one time assistant manager of a corporation\ndepartment employing sixty-six hundred men. One day\nmy secretary came in saying that Mr. B— insisted on\nspeaking with me. I told her to say that I was not interested.\nI had warned him several times that he had but one\nmore chance. Not long afterward he had called me from\nHartford on two successive days, so drunk he could hardly\nspeak. I told him he was through—finally and forever.\nMy secretary returned to say that it was not Mr. B— on\nthe phone; it was Mr. B—’s brother, and he wished to give\nme a message. I still expected a plea for clemency, but\nthese words came through the receiver: “I just wanted to\ntell you Paul jumped from a hotel window in Hartford last\nSaturday. He left us a note saying you were the best boss\nhe ever had, and that you were not to blame in any way.”\nAnother time, as I opened a letter which lay on my\n\n\ndesk, a newspaper clipping fell out. It was the obituary\nof one of the best salesmen I ever had. After two weeks\nof drinking, he had placed his toe on the trigger of a loaded\nshotgun—the barrel was in his mouth. I had discharged\nhim for drinking six weeks before.\n\nStill another experience: Awoman’s voice came faintly\nover long distance from Virginia. She wanted to know if her\nhusband’s company insurance was still in force. Four days\nbefore he had hanged himself in his woodshed. I had been\nobliged to discharge him for drinking, though he was brilliant,\nalert, and one of the best organizers I have ever known.\n\nHere were three exceptional men lost to this world because\nI did not understand alcoholism as I do now. What\nirony—I became an alcoholic myself! And but for the\nintervention of an understanding person, I might have\nfollowed in their footsteps. My downfall cost the business\ncommunity unknown thousands of dollars, for it\ntakes real money to train a man for an executive position.\nThis kind of waste goes on unabated. We think the business\nfabric is shot through with a situation which might\nbe helped by better understanding all around.\n\nNearly every modern employer feels a moral responsibility\nfor the well-being of his help, and he tries to\nmeet these responsibilities. That he has not always\ndone so for the alcoholic is easily understood. To him\nthe alcoholic has often seemed a fool of the first magnitude.\nBecause of the employee’s special ability, or\nof his own strong personal attachment to him, the employer\nhas sometimes kept such a man at work long\nbeyond a reasonable period. Some employers have\ntried every known remedy. In only a few instances\n\n\nhas there been a lack of patience and tolerance. And we,\nwho have imposed on the best of employers, can scarcely\nblame them if they have been short with us.\n\nHere, for instance, is a typical example: An officer of\none of the largest banking institutions in America knows\nI no longer drink. One day he told me about an executive\nof the same bank who, from his description, was undoubtedly\nalcoholic. This seemed to me like an opportunity\nto be helpful, so I spent two hours talking about\nalcoholism, the malady, and described the symptoms and\nresults as well as I could. His comment was, “Very interesting.\nBut I’m sure this man is done drinking. He has\njust returned from a three-months leave of absence, has\ntaken a cure, looks fine, and to clinch the matter, the\nboard of directors told him this was his last chance.”\n\nThe only answer I could make was that if the man followed\nthe usual pattern, he would go on a bigger bust\nthan ever. I felt this was inevitable and wondered if the\nbank was doing the man an injustice. Why not bring him\ninto contact with some of our alcoholic crowd? He might\nhave a chance. I pointed out that I had had nothing to\ndrink whatever for three years, and this in the face of\ndifficulties that would have made nine out of ten men\ndrink their heads off. Why not at least afford him an\nopportunity to hear my story? “Oh no,” said my friend,\n“this chap is either through with liquor, or he is minus a\njob. If he has your will power and guts, he will make the\ngrade.”\n\nI wanted to throw up my hands in discouragement,\nfor I saw that I had failed to help my banker friend\nunderstand. He simply could not believe that his\n\n\nbrother-executive suffered from a serious illness. There\nwas nothing to do but wait.\n\nPresently the man did slip and was fired. Following his\ndischarge, we contacted him. Without much ado, he accepted\nthe principles and procedure that had helped us. He\nis undoubtedly on the road to recovery. To me, this incident\nillustrates lack of understanding as to what really ails the\nalcoholic, and lack of knowledge as to what part employers\nmight profitably take in salvaging their sick employees.\n\nIf you desire to help it might be well to disregard your\nown drinking, or lack of it. Whether you are a hard drinker,\na moderate drinker or a teetotaler1, you may have some\npretty strong opinions, perhaps prejudices. Those who\ndrink moderately may be more annoyed with an alcoholic\nthan a total abstainer would be. Drinking occasionally,\nand understanding your own reactions, it is possible for\nyou to become quite sure of many things which, so far as\nthe alcoholic is concerned, are not always so. As a moderate\ndrinker, you can take your liquor or leave it alone.\nWhenever you want to, you control your drinking. Of an\nevening, you can go on a mild bender, get up in the morning,\nshake your head and go to business. To you, liquor\nis no real problem. You cannot see why it should be to\nanyone else, save the spineless and stupid.\n\nWhen dealing with an alcoholic, there may be a natural\nannoyance that a man could be so weak, stupid and irresponsible.\nEven when you understand the malady better,\nyou may feel this feeling rising.\n\nA look at the alcoholic in your organization is many\ntimes illuminating. Is he not usually brilliant, fast-\nthinking, imaginative and likeable? When sober, does\n\n\nhe not work hard and have a knack of getting things done? If\nhe had these qualities and did not drink would he be worth\nretaining? Should he have the same consideration as other\nailing employees? Is he worth salvaging? If your decision is\nyes, whether the reason be humanitarian or business or both,\nthen the following suggestions may be helpful.\n\nCan you discard the feeling that you are dealing only\nwith habit, with stubbornness, or a weak will? If this\npresents difficulty, re-reading chapters two and three,\nwhere the alcoholic sickness is discussed at length might\nbe worth while. You, as a business man, want to know\nthe necessities before considering the result. If you concede\nthat your employee is ill, can he be forgiven for\nwhat he has done in the past? Can his past absurdities be\nforgotten? Can it be appreciated that he has been a victim\nof crooked thinking, directly caused by the action of\nalcohol on his brain?\n\nI well remember the shock I received when a prominent\ndoctor in Chicago told me of cases where pressure of the\nspinal fluid actually ruptured the brain. No wonder an\nalcoholic is strangely irrational. Who wouldn’t be, with\nsuch a fevered brain? Normal drinkers are not so affected,\nnor can they understand the aberrations of the alcoholic.\nYour man has probably been trying to conceal a number\nof scrapes, perhaps pretty messy ones. They may\nbe disgusting. You may be at a loss to understand how\nsuch a seemingly above-board chap could be so involved.\nBut these scrapes can generally be charged, no\nmatter how bad, to the abnormal action of alcohol on\nhis mind. When drinking, or getting over a bout, an\nalcoholic, sometimes the model of honesty when\n\n\nnormal, will do incredible things. Afterward, his revulsion\nwill be terrible. Nearly always, these antics indicate\nnothing more than temporary conditions.\n\nThis is not to say that all alcoholics are honest and\nupright when not drinking. Of course that isn’t so, and\nsuch people often may impose on you. Seeing your\nattempt to understand and help, some men will try to\ntake advantage of your kindness. If you are sure your\nman does not want to stop, he may as well be discharged,\nthe sooner the better. You are not doing him a favor by\nkeeping him on. Firing such an individual may prove a\nblessing to him. It may be just the jolt he needs. I know,\nin my own particular case, that nothing my company\ncould have done would have stopped me for, so long as I\nwas able to hold my position, I could not possibly realize\nhow serious my situation was. Had they fired me\nfirst, and had they then taken steps to see that I was\npresented with the solution contained in this book, I might\nhave returned to them six months later, a well man.\n\nBut there are many men who want to stop, and with\nthem you can go far. Your understanding treatment of\ntheir cases will pay dividends.\n\nPerhaps you have such a man in mind. He wants to quit\ndrinking and you want to help him, even if it be only a\nmatter of good business. You now know more about alcoholism.\nYou can see that he is mentally and physically\nsick. You are willing to overlook his past performances.\nSuppose an approach is made something like this:\n\nState that you know about his drinking, and that it\nmust stop. You might say you appreciate his abilities,\nwould like to keep him, but cannot if he continues to\n\n\ndrink. A firm attitude at this point has helped many of\nus.\n\nNext he can be assured that you do not intend to lecture,\nmoralize, or condemn; that if this was done formerly,\nit was because of misunderstanding. If possible\nexpress a lack of hard feeling toward him. At this point,\nit might be well to explain alcoholism, the illness. Say\nthat you believe he is a gravely ill person, with this qualification—\nbeing perhaps fatally ill, does he want to get\nwell? You ask, because many alcoholics, being warped\nand drugged, do not want to quit. But does he? Will he\ntake every necessary step, submit to anything to get well,\nto stop drinking forever?\n\nIf he says yes, does he really mean it, or down inside\ndoes he think he is fooling you, and that after rest and\ntreatment he will be able to get away with a few drinks\nnow and then? We believe a man should be thoroughly\nprobed on these points. Be satisfied he is not deceiving\nhimself or you.\n\nWhether you mention this book is a matter for your\ndiscretion. If he temporizes and still thinks he can ever\ndrink again, even beer, he might as well be discharged\nafter the next bender which, if an alcoholic, he is almost\ncertain to have. He should understand that emphatically.\nEither you are dealing with a man who can and will get\nwell or you are not. If not, why waste time with him?\nThis may seem severe, but it is usually the best course.\nAfter satisfying yourself that your man wants to recover\nand that he will go to any extreme to do so, you\nmay suggest a definite course of action. For most\nalcoholics who are drinking, or who are just getting\n\n\nover a spree, a certain amount of physical treatment is\ndesirable, even imperative. The matter of physical treatment\nshould, of course, be referred to your own doctor.\nWhatever the method, its object is to thoroughly clear\nmind and body of the effects of alcohol. In competent\nhands, this seldom takes long nor is it very expensive.\nYour man will fare better if placed in such physical condition\nthat he can think straight and no longer craves\nliquor. If you propose such a procedure to him, it may be\nnecessary to advance the cost of treatment, but we believe\nit should be made plain that any expense will later\nbe deducted from his pay. It is better for him to feel fully\nresponsible.\n\nIf your man accepts your offer, it should be pointed\nout that physical treatment is but a small part of the\npicture. Though you are providing him with the best\npossible medical attention, he should understand that\nhe must undergo a change of heart. To get over drinking\nwill require a transformation of thought and attitude.\nWe all had to place recovery above everything,\nfor without recovery we would have lost both home\nand business.\n\nCan you have every confidence in his ability to recover?\nWhile on the subject of confidence, can you adopt the\nattitude that so far as you are concerned this will be a\nstrictly personal matter, that his alcoholic derelictions,\nthe treatment about to be undertaken, will never be discussed\nwithout his consent? It might be well to have a\nlong chat with him on his return.\n\nTo return to the subject matter of this book: It contains\nfull suggestions by which the employee may\n\n\nsolve his problem. To you, some of the ideas which it\ncontains are novel. Perhaps you are not quite in sympathy\nwith the approach we suggest. By no means do we\noffer it as the last word on this subject, but so far as we\nare concerned, it has worked with us. After all, are you\nnot looking for results rather than methods? Whether\nyour employee likes it or not, he will learn the grim truth\nabout alcoholism. That won’t hurt him a bit, even though\nhe does not go for this remedy.\n\nWe suggest you draw the book to the attention of the\ndoctor who is to attend your patient during treatment. If\nthe book is read the moment the patient is able, while\nacutely depressed, realization of his condition may come\nto him.\n\nWe hope the doctor will tell the patient the truth about\nhis condition, whatever that happens to be. When the\nman is presented with this volume it is best that no one\ntell him he must abide by its suggestions. The man must\ndecide for himself.\n\nYou are betting, of course, that your changed attitude\nplus the contents of this book will turn the trick. In\nsome cases it will, and in others it may not. But we\nthink that if you persevere, the percentage of successes\nwill gratify you. As our work spreads and our numbers\nincrease, we hope your employees may be put in personal\ncontact with some of us. Meanwhile, we are sure\na great deal can be accomplished by the use of the book\nalone.\n\nOn your employee’s return, talk with him. Ask him if\nhe thinks he has the answer. If he feels free to discuss\nhis problems with you, if he knows you under\n\n\n\nstand and will not be upset by anything he wishes to say,\nhe will probably be off to a fast start.\n\nIn this connection, can you remain undisturbed if the\nman proceeds to tell you shocking things? He may, for\nexample, reveal that he has padded his expense account\nor that he has planned to take your best customers away\nfrom you. In fact, he may say almost anything if he has\naccepted our solution which, as you know, demands rigorous\nhonesty. Can you charge this off as you would a\nbad account and start fresh with him? If he owes you\nmoney you may wish to make terms.\n\nIf he speaks of his home situation, you can undoubtedly\nmake helpful suggestions. Can he talk frankly with\nyou so long as he does not bear business tales or criticize\nhis associates? With this kind of employee such an attitude\nwill command undying loyalty.\n\nThe greatest enemies of us alcoholics are resentment,\njealousy, envy, frustration, and fear. Wherever men are\ngathered together in business there will be rivalries and,\narising out of these, a certain amount of office politics.\nSometimes we alcoholics have an idea that people are\ntrying to pull us down. Often this is not so at all. But\nsometimes our drinking will be used politically.\n\nOne instance comes to mind in which a malicious\nindividual was always making friendly little jokes about\nan alcoholic’s drinking exploits. In this way he was\nslyly carrying tales. In another case, an alcoholic was\nsent to a hospital for treatment. Only a few knew of it\nat first but, within a short time, it was billboarded\nthroughout the entire company. Naturally this sort of\nthing decreased the man’s chance of recovery. The\n\n\nemployer can many times protect the victim from this\nkind of talk. The employer cannot play favorites, but he\ncan always defend a man from needless provocation and\nunfair criticism.\n\nAs a class, alcoholics are energetic people. They work\nhard and they play hard. Your man should be on his\nmettle to make good. Being somewhat weakened, and\nfaced with physical and mental readjustment to a life\nwhich knows no alcohol, he may overdo. You may have\nto curb his desire to work sixteen hours a day. You may\nneed to encourage him to play once in a while. He may\nwish to do a lot for other alcoholics and something of the\nsort may come up during business hours. A reasonable\namount of latitude will be helpful. This work is necessary\nto maintain his sobriety.\n\nAfter your man has gone along without drinking for a\nfew months, you may be able to make use of his services\nwith other employees who are giving you the alcoholic\nrun-around—provided, of course, they are willing\nto have a third party in the picture. An alcoholic\nwho has recovered, but holds a relatively unimportant\njob, can talk to a man with a better position. Being on a\nradically different basis of life, he will never take advantage\nof the situation.\n\nYour man may be trusted. Long experience with alcoholic\nexcuses naturally arouses suspicion. When his wife next\ncalls saying he is sick, you might jump to the conclusion he\nis drunk. If he is, and is still trying to recover, he will tell you\nabout it even if it means the loss of his job. For he knows he\nmust be honest if he would live at all. He will appreciate\nknowing you are not bothering your head about him,\n\n\nthat you are not suspicious nor are you trying to run his\nlife so he will be shielded from temptation to drink. If he\nis conscientiously following the program of recovery he\ncan go anywhere your business may call him.\n\nIn case he does stumble, even once, you will have to\ndecide whether to let him go. If you are sure he doesn’t\nmean business, there is no doubt you should discharge\nhim. If, on the contrary, you are sure he is doing his\nutmost, you may wish to give him another chance. But\nyou should feel under no obligation to keep him on, for\nyour obligation has been well discharged already.\n\nThere is another thing you might wish to do. If your\norganization is a large one, your junior executives might\nbe provided with this book. You might let them know\nyou have no quarrel with the alcoholics of your organization.\nThese juniors are often in a difficult position. Men\nunder them are frequently their friends. So, for one reason\nor another, they cover these men, hoping matters\nwill take a turn for the better. They often jeopardize\ntheir own positions by trying to help serious drinkers\nwho should have been fired long ago, or else given an\nopportunity to get well.\n\nAfter reading this book, a junior executive can go to\nsuch a man and say approximately this, “Look here,\nEd. Do you want to stop drinking or not? You put me\non the spot every time you get drunk. It isn’t fair to\nme or the firm. I have been learning something about\nalcoholism. If you are an alcoholic, you are a mighty\nsick man. You act like one. The firm wants to help\nyou get over it, and if you are interested, there is a way\nout. If you take it, your past will be forgotten\n\n\nand the fact that you went away for treatment will not be\nmentioned. But if you cannot or will not stop drinking,\nI think you ought to resign.”\n\nYour junior executive may not agree with the contents\nof our book. He need not, and often should not show it\nto his alcoholic prospect. But at least he will understand\nthe problem and will no longer be misled by ordinary\npromises. He will be able to take a position with such a\nman which is eminently fair and square. He will have no\nfurther reason for covering up an alcoholic employee.\n\nIt boils right down to this: No man should be fired just\nbecause he is alcoholic. If he wants to stop, he should be\nafforded a real chance. If he cannot or does not want to\nstop, he should be discharged. The exceptions are few.\n\nWe think this method of approach will accomplish\nseveral things. It will permit the rehabilitation of good\nmen. At the same time you will feel no reluctance to rid\nyourself of those who cannot or will not stop. Alcoholism\nmay be causing your organization considerable damage\nin its waste of time, men and reputation. We hope\nour suggestions will help you plug up this sometimes\nserious leak. We think we are sensible when we urge\nthat you stop this waste and give your worthwhile man\na chance.\n\nThe other day an approach was made to the vice\npresident of a large industrial concern. He remarked:\n“I’m mighty glad you fellows got over your drinking.\nBut the policy of this company is not to interfere with\nthe habits of our employees. If a man drinks so much\nthat his job suffers, we fire him. I don’t see how you\ncan be of any help to us for, as you see, we don’t have\n\n\nany alcoholic problem.” This same company spends\nmillions for research every year. Their cost of production\nis figured to a fine decimal point. They have\nrecreational facilities. There is company insurance.\nThere is a real interest, both humanitarian and business,\nin the well-being of employees. But alcohol-\nism—well, they just don’t believe they have it.\n\nPerhaps this is a typical attitude. We, who have\ncollectively seen a great deal of business life, at least\nfrom the alcoholic angle, had to smile at this gentleman’s\nsincere opinion. He might be shocked if he knew how\nmuch alcoholism is costing his organization a year. That\ncompany may harbor many actual or potential alcoholics.\nWe believe that managers of large enterprises\noften have little idea how prevalent this problem is.\nEven if you feel your organization has no alcoholic\nproblem, it might pay to take another look down the\nline. You may make some interesting discoveries.\n\nOf course, this chapter refers to alcoholics, sick\npeople, deranged men. What our friend, the vice\npresident, had in mind was the habitual or whoopee\ndrinker. As to them, his policy is undoubtedly sound,\nbut he did not distinguish between such people and\nthe alcoholic.\n\nIt is not to be expected that an alcoholic employee will\nreceive a disproportionate amount of time and attention.\nHe should not be made a favorite. The right kind\nof man, the kind who recovers, will not want this sort of\nthing. He will not impose. Far from it. He will work\nlike the devil and thank you to his dying day.\nToday I own a little company. There are two\n\n\nalcoholic employees, who produce as much as five normal\nsalesmen. But why not? They have a new attitude,\nand they have been saved from a living death. I have\nenjoyed every moment spent in getting them straightened\nout.\n\nNote\n1 Teetotaler: a person who does not drink alcohol.\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nA VISION FOR YOU\n\nF\nF\nOR MOST normal folks, drinking means conviviality,\ncompanionship and colorful imagination.\nIt means release from care, boredom and worry. It is\njoyous intimacy with friends and a feeling that life is\ngood. But not so with us in those last days of heavy\ndrinking. The old pleasures were gone. They were but\nmemories. Never could we recapture the great moments\nof the past. There was an insistent yearning to enjoy life\nas we once did and a heartbreaking obsession that some\nnew miracle of control would enable us to do it. There\nwas always one more attempt—and one more failure.\n\nThe less people tolerated us, the more we withdrew\nfrom society, from life itself. As we became subjects of\nKing Alcohol, shivering denizens of his mad realm, the\nchilling vapor that is loneliness settled down. It thickened,\never becoming blacker. Some of us sought out sordid\nplaces, hoping to find understanding companionship\nand approval. Momentarily we did—then would come\noblivion and the awful awakening to face the hideous\nFour Horsemen—Terror, Bewilderment, Frustration,\nDespair. Unhappy drinkers who read this page will understand!\n\n\nNow and then a serious drinker, being dry at the moment\nsays, “I don’t miss it at all. Feel better. Work\nbetter. Having a better time.” As ex-problem drink\n\n\n\ners, we smile at such a sally. We know our friend is like\na boy whistling in the dark to keep up his spirits. He\nfools himself. Inwardly he would give anything to take\nhalf a dozen drinks and get away with them. He will\npresently try the old game again, for he isn’t happy about\nhis sobriety. He cannot picture life without alcohol. Some\nday he will be unable to imagine life either with alcohol or\nwithout it. Then he will know loneliness such as few do.\nHe will be at the jumping-off place. He will wish for the\nend.\n\nWe have shown how we got out from under. You say,\n“Yes, I’m willing. But am I to be consigned to a life\nwhere I shall be stupid, boring and glum, like some righteous\npeople I see? I know I must get along without\nliquor, but how can I? Have you a sufficient substitute?”\n\nYes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that.\nIt is a fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous. There you\nwill find release from care, boredom and worry. Your\nimagination will be fired. Life will mean something at\nlast. The most satisfactory years of your existence lie\nahead. Thus we find the fellowship, and so will you.\n\n“How is that to come about?” you ask. “Where am I to\nfind these people?”\n\nYou are going to meet these new friends in your own\ncommunity. Near you, alcoholics are dying helplessly\nlike people in a sinking ship. If you live in a large\nplace, there are hundreds. High and low, rich and poor,\nthese are future fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.\nAmong them you will make lifelong friends. You will\nbe bound to them with new and wonderful ties, for\nyou will escape disaster together and you will\n\n\ncommence shoulder to shoulder your common journey.\nThen you will know what it means to give of yourself\nthat others may survive and rediscover life. You will\nlearn the full meaning of “Love thy neighbor as thyself.”\n\nIt may seem incredible that these men are to become\nhappy, respected, and useful once more. How can they\nrise out of such misery, bad repute and hopelessness?\nThe practical answer is that since these things have happened\namong us, they can happen with you. Should\nyou wish them above all else, and be willing to make use\nof our experience, we are sure they will come. The age\nof miracles is still with us. Our own recovery proves\nthat!\n\nOur hope is that when this chip of a book is launched\non the world tide of alcoholism, defeated drinkers will\nseize upon it, to follow its suggestions. Many, we are\nsure, will rise to their feet and march on. They will\napproach still other sick ones and fellowships of Alcoholics\nAnonymous may spring up in each city and hamlet,\nhavens for those who must find a way out.\n\nIn the chapter “Working With Others” you gathered an\nidea of how we approach and aid others to health. Suppose\nnow that through you several families have adopted\nthis way of life. You will want to know more of how to\nproceed from that point. Perhaps the best way of treating\nyou to a glimpse of your future will be to describe the\ngrowth of the fellowship among us. Here is a brief account:\n\n\nYears ago, in 1935, one of our number made a journey\nto a certain western city. From a business standpoint,\nhis trip came off badly. Had he been suc\n\n\n\ncessful in his enterprise, he would have been set on his\nfeet financially which, at the time, seemed vitally important.\nBut his venture wound up in a law suit and bogged\ndown completely. The proceeding was shot through with\nmuch hard feeling and controversy.\n\nBitterly discouraged, he found himself in a strange place,\ndiscredited and almost broke. Still physically weak, and\nsober but a few months, he saw that his predicament was\ndangerous. He wanted so much to talk with someone,\nbut whom?\n\nOne dismal afternoon he paced a hotel lobby wondering\nhow his bill was to be paid. At one end of the room stood\na glass covered directory of local churches. Down the\nlobby a door opened into an attractive bar. He could see\nthe gay crowd inside. In there he would find companionship\nand release. Unless he took some drinks, he might\nnot have the courage to scrape an acquaintance and would\nhave a lonely week-end.\n\nOf course he couldn’t drink, but why not sit hopefully\nat a table, a bottle of ginger ale before him? After all, had\nhe not been sober six months now? Perhaps he could\nhandle, say, three drinks—no more! Fear gripped him.\nHe was on thin ice. Again it was the old, insidious insanity—\nthat first drink. With a shiver, he turned away and\nwalked down the lobby to the church directory. Music\nand gay chatter still floated to him from the bar.\n\nBut what about his responsibilities—his family and\nthe men who would die because they would not know\nhow to get well, ah—yes, those other alcoholics? There\nmust be many such in this town. He would phone a\nclergyman. His sanity returned and he thanked\n\n\nGod. Selecting a church at random from the directory,\nhe stepped into a booth and lifted the receiver.\n\nHis call to the clergyman led him presently to a certain\nresident of the town, who, though formerly able and\nrespected, was then nearing the nadir of alcoholic despair.\nIt was the usual situation: home in jeopardy, wife\nill, children distracted, bills in arrears and standing damaged.\nHe had a desperate desire to stop, but saw no\nway out, for he had earnestly tried many avenues of\nescape. Painfully aware of being somehow abnormal,\nthe man did not fully realize what it meant to be alcoholic.*\n\n\nWhen our friend related his experience, the man agreed\nthat no amount of will power he might muster could\nstop his drinking for long. A spiritual experience, he\nconceded, was absolutely necessary, but the price\nseemed high upon the basis suggested. He told how he\nlived in constant worry about those who might find out\nabout his alcoholism. He had, of course, the familiar\nalcoholic obsession that few knew of his drinking. Why,\nhe argued, should he lose the remainder of his business,\nonly to bring still more suffering to his family by foolishly\nadmitting his plight to people from whom he made\nhis livelihood? He would do anything, he said, but that.\nBeing intrigued, however, he invited our friend to\nhis home. Some time later, and just as he thought he\nwas getting control of his liquor situation, he went on\na roaring bender. For him, this was the spree that\nended all sprees. He saw that he would have to face\n\n*This refers to Bill’s first visit with Dr. Bob. These men later became co-founders\nof A.A. This resulted in A.A.’s first group, in Akron, Ohio, in 1935.\n\n\nhis problems squarely that God might give him mastery.\n\nOne morning he took the bull by the horns and set\nout to tell those he feared what his trouble had been.\nHe found himself surprisingly well received, and\nlearned that many knew of his drinking. Stepping\ninto his car, he made the rounds of people he had\nhurt. He trembled as he went about, for this might\nmean ruin, particularly to a person in his line of\nbusiness.\n\nAt midnight he came home exhausted, but very\nhappy. He has not had a drink since. As we shall\nsee, he now means a great deal to his community, and\nthe major liabilities of thirty years of hard drinking\nhave been repaired in four.\n\nBut life was not easy for the two friends. Plenty of\ndifficulties presented themselves. Both saw that they\nmust keep spiritually active. One day they called up\nthe head nurse of a local hospital. They explained\ntheir need and inquired if she had a first class alcoholic\nprospect.\n\nShe replied, “Yes, we’ve got a corker. He’s just\nbeaten up a couple of nurses. Goes off his head completely\nwhen he’s drinking. But he’s a grand chap\nwhen he’s sober, though he’s been in here eight times\nin the last six months. Understand he was once a\nwell-known lawyer in town, but just now we’ve got\nhim strapped down tight.” *\n\nHere was a prospect all right but, by the description,\nnone too promising. The use of spiritual principles in\n\n*This refers to Bill’s and Dr. Bob’s first visit to A.A. Number Three.\n\n\nsuch cases was not so well understood as it is now. But\none of the friends said, “Put him in a private room. We’ll\nbe down.”\n\nTwo days later, a future fellow of Alcoholics Anonymous\nstared glassily at the strangers beside his bed. “Who\nare you fellows, and why this private room? I was always\nin a ward before.”\n\nSaid one of the visitors, “We’re giving you a treatment\nfor alcoholism.”\n\nHopelessness was written large on the man’s face as he\nreplied, “Oh, but that’s no use. Nothing would fix me.\nI’m a goner. The last three times, I got drunk on the way\nhome from here. I’m afraid to go out the door. I can’t\nunderstand it.”\n\nFor an hour, the two friends told him about their drinking\nexperiences. Over and over, he would say: “That’s\nme. That’s me. I drink like that.”\n\nThe man in the bed was told of the acute poisoning\nfrom which he suffered, how it deteriorates the body of\nan alcoholic and warps his mind. There was much talk\nabout the mental state preceding the first drink.\n\n“Yes, that’s me,” said the sick man, “the very image.\nYou fellows know your stuff all right, but I don’t see\nwhat good it’ll do. You fellows are somebody. I was\nonce, but I’m a nobody now. From what you tell me, I\nknow more than ever I can’t stop.” At this both the\nvisitors burst into a laugh. Said the future Fellow Anonymous:\n“Damn little to laugh about that I can see.”\n\nThe two friends spoke of their spiritual experience and\ntold him about the course of action they carried out.\n\nHe interrupted: “I used to be strong for the church,\n\n\nbut that won’t fix it. I’ve prayed to God on hangover mornings\nand sworn that I’d never touch another drop but by nine\no’clock I’d be boiled as an owl.”\n\nNext day found the prospect more receptive. He had been\nthinking it over. “Maybe you’re right,” he said. “God ought\nto be able to do anything.” Then he added, “He sure didn’t do\nmuch for me when I was trying to fight this booze racket\nalone.”\n\nOn the third day the lawyer gave his life to the care and\ndirection of his Creator, and said he was perfectly willing to do\nanything necessary. His wife came, scarcely daring to be hopeful,\nthough she thought she saw something different about her\nhusband already. He had begun to have a spiritual experience.\n\nThat afternoon he put on his clothes and walked from the\nhospital a free man. He entered a political campaign, making\nspeeches, frequenting men’s gathering places of all sorts, often\nstaying up all night. He lost the race by only a narrow\nmargin. But he had found God—and in finding God had\nfound himself.\n\nThat was in June, 1935. He never drank again. He too, has\nbecome a respected and useful member of his community. He\nhas helped other men recover, and is a power in the church\nfrom which he was long absent.\n\nSo, you see, there were three alcoholics in that town, who\nnow felt they had to give to others what they had found, or be\nsunk. After several failures to find others, a fourth turned up.\nHe came through an acquaintance who had heard the good\nnews. He proved to be a devil-may-care young fellow whose\nparents could not make out whether he wanted to stop drinking\nor not. They were deeply religious people, much shocked\nby their son’s refusal to have anything to do with the\n\n\nchurch. He suffered horribly from his sprees, but it\nseemed as if nothing could be done for him. He consented,\nhowever, to go to the hospital, where he occupied\nthe very room recently vacated by the lawyer.\n\nHe had three visitors. After a bit, he said, “The way\nyou fellows put this spiritual stuff makes sense. I’m\nready to do business. I guess the old folks were right\nafter all.” So one more was added to the Fellowship.\n\nAll this time our friend of the hotel lobby incident remained\nin that town. He was there three months. He now\nreturned home, leaving behind his first acquaintance, the\nlawyer and the devil-may-care chap. These men had found\nsomething brand new in life. Though they knew they must\nhelp other alcoholics if they would remain sober, that motive\nbecame secondary. It was transcended by the happiness\nthey found in giving themselves for others. They\nshared their homes, their slender resources, and gladly devoted\ntheir spare hours to fellow-sufferers. They were\nwilling, by day or night, to place a new man in the hospital\nand visit him afterward. They grew in numbers. They\nexperienced a few distressing failures, but in those cases\nthey made an effort to bring the man’s family into a spiritual\nway of living, thus relieving much worry and suffering.\n\nA year and six months later these three had succeeded\nwith seven more. Seeing much of each other,\nscarce an evening passed that someone’s home did\nnot shelter a little gathering of men and women, happy\nin their release, and constantly thinking how they might\npresent their discovery to some newcomer. In addition\nto these casual get-togethers, it became customary\nto set apart one night a week for a meeting to be at\n\n\n\ntended by anyone or everyone interested in a spiritual\nway of life. Aside from fellowship and sociability, the\nprime object was to provide a time and place where new\npeople might bring their problems.\n\nOutsiders became interested. One man and his wife\nplaced their large home at the disposal of this strangely\nassorted crowd. This couple has since become so fascinated\nthat they have dedicated their home to the work.\nMany a distracted wife has visited this house to find\nloving and understanding companionship among women\nwho knew her problem, to hear from the lips of their\nhusbands what had happened to them, to be advised how\nher own wayward mate might be hospitalized and approached\nwhen next he stumbled.\n\nMany a man, yet dazed from his hospital experience,\nhas stepped over the threshold of that home into freedom.\nMany an alcoholic who entered there came away\nwith an answer. He succumbed to that gay crowd inside,\nwho laughed at their own misfortunes and understood\nhis. Impressed by those who visited him at the hospital,\nhe capitulated entirely when, later, in an upper room of\nthis house, he heard the story of some man whose experience\nclosely tallied with his own. The expression on\nthe faces of the women, that indefinable something in the\neyes of the men, the stimulating and electric atmosphere\nof the place, conspired to let him know that here was\nhaven at last.\n\nThe very practical approach to his problems, the\nabsence of intolerance of any kind, the informality,\nthe genuine democracy, the uncanny understanding\nwhich these people had were irresistible. He and his\n\n\nwife would leave elated by the thought of what they\ncould now do for some stricken acquaintance and his\nfamily. They knew they had a host of new friends; it\nseemed they had known these strangers always. They\nhad seen miracles, and one was to come to them. They\nhad visioned the Great Reality—their loving and All Powerful\nCreator.\n\nNow, this house will hardly accommodate its weekly\nvisitors, for they number sixty or eighty as a rule. Alcoholics\nare being attracted from far and near. From surrounding\ntowns, families drive long distances to be present.\nA community thirty miles away has fifteen fellows of\nAlcoholics Anonymous. Being a large place, we think\nthat some day its Fellowship will number many hundreds.*\n\n\nBut life among Alcoholics Anonymous is more than attending\ngatherings and visiting hospitals. Cleaning up old\nscrapes, helping to settle family differences, explaining the\ndisinherited son to his irate parents, lending money and\nsecuring jobs for each other, when justified—these are everyday\noccurrences. No one is too discredited or has sunk\ntoo low to be welcomed cordially—if he means business.\nSocial distinctions, petty rivalries and jealousies—these\nare laughed out of countenance. Being wrecked in the same\nvessel, being restored and united under one God, with hearts\nand minds attuned to the welfare of others, the things\nwhich matter so much to some people no longer signify\nmuch to them. How could they?\n\nUnder only slightly different conditions, the same\nthing is taking place in many eastern cities. In one of\n*Written in 1939.\n\n\nthese there is a well-known hospital for the treatment of\nalcoholic and drug addiction. Six years ago one of our\nnumber was a patient there. Many of us have felt, for the\nfirst time, the Presence and Power of God within its\nwalls. We are greatly indebted to the doctor in attendance\nthere, for he, although it might prejudice his own\nwork, has told us of his belief in ours.\n\nEvery few days this doctor suggests our approach to\none of his patients. Understanding our work, he can do\nthis with an eye to selecting those who are willing and\nable to recover on a spiritual basis. Many of us, former\npatients, go there to help. Then, in this eastern city,\nthere are informal meetings such as we have described to\nyou, where you may now see scores of members. There\nare the same fast friendships, there is the same helpfulness\nto one another as you find among our western friends.\nThere is a good bit of travel between East and West and\nwe foresee a great increase in this helpful interchange.\n\nSome day we hope that every alcoholic who journeys\nwill find a Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous at his\ndestination. To some extent this is already true. Some of\nus are salesmen and go about. Little clusters of twos and\nthrees and fives of us have sprung up in other communities,\nthrough contact with our two larger centers. Those\nof us who travel drop in as often as we can. This practice\nenables us to lend a hand, at the same time avoiding certain\nalluring distractions of the road, about which any\ntraveling man can inform you.*\n\nThus we grow. And so can you, though you be but\n\n*Written in 1939. In 1993 there are over 89,000 groups.

We believe and\nhope it contains all you will need to begin.\n\nWe know what you are thinking. You are saying to\nyourself: “I’m jittery and alone. I couldn’t do that.” But\nyou can. You forget that you have just now tapped a\nsource of power much greater than yourself. To duplicate,\nwith such backing, what we have accomplished is\nonly a matter of willingness, patience and labor.\n\nWe know of an A.A. member who was living in a large\ncommunity. He had lived there but a few weeks when he\nfound that the place probably contained more alcoholics\nper square mile than any city in the country. This was\nonly a few days ago at this writing. (1939) The authorities\nwere much concerned. He got in touch with a prominent\npsychiatrist who had undertaken certain responsibilities\nfor the mental health of the community. The\ndoctor proved to be able and exceedingly anxious to adopt\nany workable method of handling the situation. So he\ninquired, what did our friend have on the ball?\n\nOur friend proceeded to tell him. And with such good\neffect that the doctor agreed to a test among his patients\nand certain other alcoholics from a clinic which he attends.\nArrangements were also made with the chief psychiatrist\nof a large public hospital to select still others\nfrom the stream of misery which flows through that institution.\n\n\nSo our fellow worker will soon have friends galore.\nSome of them may sink and perhaps never get up, but if\nour experience is a criterion, more than half of those\napproached will become fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.\nWhen a few men in this city have found them\n\n\n\nselves, and have discovered the joy of helping others to\nface life again, there will be no stopping until everyone in\nthat town has had his opportunity to recover—if he can\nand will.\n\nStill you may say: “But I will not have the benefit of\ncontact with you who write this book.” We cannot be\nsure. God will determine that, so you must remember\nthat your real reliance is always upon Him. He will show\nyou how to create the fellowship you crave.*\n\nOur book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we\nknow only a little. God will constantly disclose more to\nyou and to us. Ask Him in your morning meditation\nwhat you can do each day for the man who is still sick.\nThe answers will come, if your own house is in order.\nBut obviously you cannot transmit something you\nhaven’t got. See to it that your relationship with Him is\nright, and great events will come to pass for you and\ncountless others. This is the Great Fact for us.\n\nAbandon yourself to God as you understand God.\nAdmit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear\naway the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what\nyou find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship\nof the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as\nyou trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.\n\nMay God bless you and keep you—until then.\n\n*Alcoholics Anonymous will be glad to hear from you.\nAddress: PO Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163.\n\n\nDOCTOR BOB’S NIGHTMARE\n\nA co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. The birth of\nour Society dates from his first day of permanent sobriety,\nJune 10, 1935. To 1950, the year of his death, he\ncarried the A.A. message to more than 5,000 alcoholic\nmen and women, and to all these he gave his medical\nservices without thought of charge. In this prodigy of\nservice, he was well assisted by Sister Ignatia at St. Thomas\nHospital in Akron, Ohio, one of the greatest friends\nour Fellowship will ever know.\n\nI\nI\nWAS BORN in a small New England village of about\n\nseven thousand souls. The general moral standard was,\n\nas I recall it, far above the average. No beer or liquor was\n\nsold in the neighborhood, except at the State liquor agency\n\nwhere perhaps one might procure a pint if he could con\n\n\nvince the agent that he really needed it. Without this\n\nproof the expectant purchaser would be forced to depart\n\nempty handed with none of what I later came to believe\n\nwas the great panacea for all human ills. Men who had\n\nliquor shipped in from Boston or New York by express\n\nwere looked upon with great distrust and disfavor by\n\nmost of the good townspeople. The town was well sup\n\n\nplied with churches and schools in which I pursued my\n\nearly educational activities.\n\nMy father was a professional man of recognized\n\nability and both my father and mother were most\n\n171\n\n\nactive in church affairs. Both father and mother were\nconsiderably above the average in intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I was the only child, which perhaps\nengendered the selfishness which played such an\nimportant part in bringing on my alcoholism.\n\nFrom childhood through high school I was more or less\nforced to go to church, Sunday School and evening service,\nMonday night Christian Endeavor and sometimes to Wednesday\nevening prayer meeting. This had the effect of making\nme resolve that when I was free from parental domination, I\nwould never again darken the doors of a church. This resolution\nI kept steadfastly for the next forty years, except\nwhen circumstances made it seem unwise to absent myself.\n\nAfter high school came four years in one of the best\ncolleges in the country where drinking seemed to be a\nmajor extra-curricular activity. Almost everyone seemed\nto do it. I did it more and more, and had lots of fun\nwithout much grief, either physical or financial. I seemed\nto be able to snap back the next morning better than most\nof my fellow drinkers, who were cursed (or perhaps\nblessed) with a great deal of morning-after nausea. Never\nonce in my life have I had a headache, which fact leads me\nto believe that I was an alcoholic almost from the start.\nMy whole life seemed to be centered around doing what\nI wanted to do, without regard for the rights, wishes, or\nprivileges of anyone else; a state of mind which became\nmore and more predominant as the years passed. I was\ngraduated “summa cum laude” in the eyes of the drinking\nfraternity, but not in the eyes of the Dean.\n\nThe next three years I spent in Boston, Chicago, and\nMontreal in the employ of a large manufacturing con\n\n\n\ncern, selling railway supplies, gas engines of all sorts, and\nmany other items of heavy hardware. During these years,\nI drank as much as my purse permitted, still without\npaying too great a penalty, although I was beginning to\nhave morning jitters at times. I lost only a half day’s\nwork during these three years.\n\nMy next move was to take up the study of medicine,\nentering one of the largest universities in the country.\nThere I took up the business of drinking with much greater\nearnestness than I had previously shown. On account of\nmy enormous capacity for beer, I was elected to membership\nin one of the drinking societies, and soon became\none of the leading spirits. Many mornings I have gone to\nclasses, and even though fully prepared, would turn and\nwalk back to the fraternity house because of my jitters,\nnot daring to enter the classroom for fear of making a\nscene should I be called on for recitation.\n\nThis went from bad to worse until Sophomore spring\nwhen, after a prolonged period of drinking, I made up\nmy mind that I could not complete my course, so I\npacked my grip and went South to spend a month on a\nlarge farm owned by a friend of mine. When I got the\nfog out of my brain, I decided that quitting school was\nvery foolish and that I had better return and continue\nmy work. When I reached school, I discovered the\nfaculty had other ideas on the subject. After much\nargument they allowed me to return and take my exams,\nall of which I passed creditably. But they were\nmuch disgusted and told me they would attempt to\nstruggle along without my presence. After many painful\ndiscussions, they finally gave me my credits and I\n\n\nmigrated to another of the leading universities of the country\nand entered as a Junior that fall.\n\nThere my drinking became so much worse that the boys\nin the fraternity house where I lived felt forced to send\nfor my father, who made a long journey in the vain endeavor\nto get me straightened around. This had little\neffect however for I kept on drinking and used a great\ndeal more hard liquor than in former years.\n\nComing up to final exams I went on a particularly strenuous\nspree. When I went in to write the examinations, my\nhand trembled so I could not hold a pencil. I passed in at\nleast three absolutely blank books. I was, of course,\nsoon on the carpet and the upshot was that I had to go\nback for two more quarters and remain absolutely dry, if\nI wished to graduate. This I did, and proved myself\nsatisfactory to the faculty, both in deportment and scholastically.\n\n\nI conducted myself so creditably that I was able to\nsecure a much coveted internship in a western city, where\nI spent two years. During these two years I was kept so\nbusy that I hardly left the hospital at all. Consequently,\nI could not get into any trouble.\n\nWhen those two years were up, I opened an office downtown.\nI had some money, all the time in the world, and\nconsiderable stomach trouble. I soon discovered that a\ncouple of drinks would alleviate my gastric distress, at\nleast for a few hours at a time, so it was not at all difficult\nfor me to return to my former excessive indulgence.\n\nBy this time I was beginning to pay very dearly\nphysically and, in hope of relief, voluntarily incarcerated\nmyself at least a dozen times in one of the\n\n\nlocal sanitariums. I was between Scylla and Charybdis\nnow, because if I did not drink my stomach tortured me,\nand if I did, my nerves did the same thing. After three\nyears of this, I wound up in the local hospital where they\nattempted to help me, but I would get my friends to\nsmuggle me a quart, or I would steal the alcohol about the\nbuilding, so that I got rapidly worse.\n\nFinally my father had to send a doctor out from my\nhome town who managed to get me back there in some\nway, and I was in bed about two months before I could\nventure out of the house. I stayed about town a couple\nof months more and then returned to resume my practice.\nI think I must have been thoroughly scared by what\nhad happened, or by the doctor, or probably both, so\nthat I did not touch a drink again until the country went\ndry.\n\nWith the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment I felt\nquite safe. I knew everyone would buy a few bottles, or\ncases, of liquor as their exchequers permitted, and that it\nwould soon be gone. Therefore it would make no great\ndifference, even if I should do some drinking. At that\ntime I was not aware of the almost unlimited supply the\ngovernment made it possible for us doctors to obtain,\nneither had I any knowledge of the bootlegger who soon\nappeared on the horizon. I drank with moderation at\nfirst, but it took me only a relatively short time to drift\nback into the old habits which had wound up so disastrously\nbefore.\n\nDuring the next few years, I developed two distinct\nphobias. One was the fear of not sleeping, and the\nother was the fear of running out of liquor. Not being\n\n\na man of means, I knew that if I did not stay sober enough\nto earn money, I would run out of liquor. Most of the\ntime, therefore, I did not take the morning drink which I\ncraved so badly, but instead would fill up on large doses\nof sedatives to quiet the jitters, which distressed me terribly.\nOccasionally, I would yield to the morning craving,\nbut if I did, it would be only a few hours before I\nwould be quite unfit for work. This would lessen my\nchances of smuggling some home that evening, which in\nturn would mean a night of futile tossing around in bed\nfollowed by a morning of unbearable jitters. During the\nsubsequent fifteen years I had sense enough never to go\nto the hospital if I had been drinking, and very seldom did\nI receive patients. I would sometimes hide out in one of\nthe clubs of which I was a member, and had the habit at\ntimes of registering at a hotel under a fictitious name. But\nmy friends usually found me and I would go home if they\npromised that I should not be scolded.\n\nIf my wife was planning to go out in the afternoon, I\nwould get a large supply of liquor and smuggle it home\nand hide it in the coal bin, the clothes chute, over door\njambs, over beams in the cellar and in cracks in the cellar\ntile. I also made use of old trunks and chests, the old can\ncontainer, and even the ash container. The water tank on\nthe toilet I never used, because that looked too easy. I\nfound out later that my wife inspected it frequently. I\nused to put eight or twelve ounce bottles of alcohol in a\nfur lined glove and toss it onto the back airing porch\nwhen winter days got dark enough. My bootlegger had\nhidden alcohol at the back steps where I could get it at\nmy convenience. Sometimes I would bring it in my\n\n\npockets, but they were inspected, and that became too\nrisky. I used also to put it up in four ounce bottles and\nstick several in my stocking tops. This worked nicely\nuntil my wife and I went to see Wallace Beery in “Tugboat\nAnnie,” after which the pant-leg and stocking racket\nwere out!\n\nI will not take space to relate all my hospital or sanitarium\nexperiences.\n\nDuring all this time we became more or less ostracized by\nour friends. We could not be invited out because I would\nsurely get tight and my wife dared not invite people in for\nthe same reason. My phobia for sleeplessness demanded\nthat I get drunk every night, but in order to get more liquor\nfor the next night, I had to stay sober during the day, at\nleast up to four o’clock. This routine went on with few\ninterruptions for seventeen years. It was really a horrible\nnightmare, this earning money, getting liquor, smuggling it\nhome, getting drunk, morning jitters, taking large doses of\nsedatives to make it possible for me to earn more money,\nand so on ad nauseam. I used to promise my wife, my\nfriends, and my children that I would drink no more—\npromises which seldom kept me sober even through the\nday, though I was very sincere when I made them.\n\nFor the benefit of those experimentally inclined, I\nshould mention the so-called beer experiment. When\nbeer first came back, I thought that I was safe. I could\ndrink all I wanted of that. It was harmless; nobody\never got drunk on beer. So I filled the cellar full, with\nthe permission of my good wife. It was not long before\nI was drinking at least a case and a half a day. I\nput on thirty pounds of weight in about two\n\n\nmonths, looked like a pig, and was uncomfortable from\nshortness of breath. It then occurred to me that after one\nwas all smelled up with beer nobody could tell what had\nbeen drunk, so I began to fortify my beer with straight\nalcohol. Of course, the result was very bad, and that\nended the beer experiment.\n\nAbout the time of the beer experiment I was thrown in\nwith a crowd of people who attracted me because of their\nseeming poise, health, and happiness. They spoke with\ngreat freedom from embarrassment, which I could never\ndo, and they seemed very much at ease on all occasions\nand appeared very healthy. More than these attributes,\nthey seemed to be happy. I was self conscious and ill at\nease most of the time, my health was at the breaking\npoint, and I was thoroughly miserable. I sensed they had\nsomething I did not have, from which I might readily\nprofit. I learned that it was something of a spiritual\nnature, which did not appeal to me very much, but I\nthought it could do no harm. I gave the matter much time\nand study for the next two and a half years, but still got\ntight every night nevertheless. I read everything I could\nfind, and talked to everyone who I thought knew anything\nabout it.\n\nMy wife became deeply interested and it was her\ninterest that sustained mine, though I at no time sensed\nthat it might be an answer to my liquor problem. How\nmy wife kept her faith and courage during all those\nyears, I’ll never know, but she did. If she had not, I\nknow I would have been dead a long time ago. For\nsome reason, we alcoholics seem to have the gift of\npicking out the world’s finest women. Why they\n\n\nshould be subjected to the tortures we inflict upon them,\nI cannot explain.\n\nAbout this time a lady called up my wife one Saturday\nafternoon, saying she wanted me to come over that evening\nto meet a friend of hers who might help me. It was the\nday before Mother’s Day and I had come home plastered,\ncarrying a big potted plant which I set down on the\ntable and forthwith went upstairs and passed out. The\nnext day she called again. Wishing to be polite, though I\nfelt very badly, I said, “Let’s make the call,” and extracted\nfrom my wife a promise that we would not stay\nover fifteen minutes.\n\nWe entered her house at exactly five o’clock and it was\neleven fifteen when we left. I had a couple of shorter\ntalks with this man afterward, and stopped drinking\nabruptly. This dry spell lasted for about three weeks;\nthen I went to Atlantic City to attend several days’ meeting\nof a national society of which I was a member. I drank\nall the scotch they had on the train and bought several\nquarts on my way to the hotel. This was on Sunday. I\ngot tight that night, stayed sober Monday till after the\ndinner and then proceeded to get tight again. I drank all I\ndared in the bar, and then went to my room to finish the\njob. Tuesday I started in the morning, getting well organized\nby noon. I did not want to disgrace myself so I\nthen checked out. I bought some more liquor on the way\nto the depot. I had to wait some time for the train. I\nremember nothing from then on until I woke up at a\nfriend’s house, in a town near home. These good people\nnotified my wife, who sent my newly made friend over\nto get me. He came and got me home and to bed, gave\n\n\nme a few drinks that night, and one bottle of beer the next\nmorning.\n\nThat was June 10, 1935, and that was my last drink.\nAs I write nearly four years have passed.\n\nThe question which might naturally come into your\nmind would be: “What did the man do or say that was\ndifferent from what others had done or said?” It must\nbe remembered that I had read a great deal and talked\nto everyone who knew, or thought they knew anything\nabout the subject of alcoholism. But this was a\nman who had experienced many years of frightful\ndrinking, who had had most all the drunkard’s experiences\nknown to man, but who had been cured by the\nvery means I had been trying to employ, that is to say\nthe spiritual approach. He gave me information about\nthe subject of alcoholism which was undoubtedly helpful.\nOf far more importance was the fact that he was\nthe first living human with whom I had ever talked,\nwho knew what he was talking about in regard to alcoholism\nfrom actual experience. In other words, he\ntalked my language. He knew all the answers, and\ncertainly not because he had picked them up in his\nreading.\n\nIt is a most wonderful blessing to be relieved of the\nterrible curse with which I was afflicted. My health is\ngood and I have regained my self-respect and the respect\nof my colleagues. My home life is ideal and my\nbusiness is as good as can be expected in these uncertain\ntimes.\n\nI spend a great deal of time passing on what I learned to\nothers who want and need it badly. I do it for four reasons:\n\n\n1. Sense of duty.\n2. It is a pleasure.\n3. Because in so doing I am paying my debt to the\nman who took time to pass it on to me.\n4. Because every time I do it I take out a little more\ninsurance for myself against a possible slip.\n\n\nUnlike most of our crowd, I did not get over my craving\nfor liquor much during the first two and one-half years of\nabstinence. It was almost always with me. But at no\ntime have I been anywhere near yielding. I used to get\nterribly upset when I saw my friends drink and knew I\ncould not, but I schooled myself to believe that though I\nonce had the same privilege, I had abused it so frightfully\nthat it was withdrawn. So it doesn’t behoove me to\nsquawk about it for, after all, nobody ever had to throw\nme down and pour liquor down my throat.\n\nIf you think you are an atheist, an agnostic, a skeptic, or\nhave any other form of intellectual pride which keeps\nyou from accepting what is in this book, I feel sorry for\nyou. If you still think you are strong enough to beat the\ngame alone, that is your affair. But if you really and truly\nwant to quit drinking liquor for good and all, and sincerely\nfeel that you must have some help, we know that\nwe have an answer for you. It never fails, if you go about\nit with one half the zeal you have been in the habit of\nshowing when you were getting another drink.\n\nYour Heavenly Father will never let you down!\n\n\nT\nT\nhe terms “spiritual experience” and “spiritual awakening”\nare used many times in this book which, upon\ncareful reading, shows that the personality change sufficient\nto bring about recovery from alcoholism has manifested\nitself among us in many different forms.\n\nYet it is true that our first printing gave many readers\nthe impression that these personality changes, or religious\nexperiences, must be in the nature of sudden and\nspectacular upheavals. Happily for everyone, this conclusion\nis erroneous.\n\nIn the first few chapters a number of sudden revolutionary\nchanges are described. Though it was not our intention to\ncreate such an impression, many alcoholics have nevertheless\nconcluded that in order to recover they must acquire an\nimmediate and overwhelming “God-consciousness” followed\nat once by a vast change in feeling and outlook.\n\nAmong our rapidly growing membership of thousands\nof alcoholics such transformations, though frequent,\nare by no means the rule. Most of our experiences\nare what the psychologist William James calls\nthe “educational variety” because they develop\nslowly over a period of time. Quite often friends of\nthe newcomer are aware of the difference long before\nhe is himself. He finally realizes that he has undergone\na profound alteration in his reaction to life; that\nsuch a change could hardly have been brought about\nby himself alone. What often takes place in a few\nmonths could seldom have been accomplished by\nyears of self discipline. With few exceptions our\nmembers find that they have tapped an unsuspected\n\n\n570\ninner resource which they presently identify with their\nown conception of a Power greater than themselves.\nMost of us think this awareness of a Power greater than\nourselves is the essence of spiritual experience. Our more\nreligious members call it “God-consciousness.”\nMost emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic\ncapable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our\nexperience can recover, provided he does not close his\nmind to all spiritual concepts. He can only be defeated\nby an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.\nWe find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality\nof the program. Willingness, honesty and open\nmindedness are the essentials of recovery. But these are\nindispensable.\n\n“There is a principle which is a bar against all information,\nwhich is proof against all arguments and which cannot\nfail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance—that principle\nis contempt prior to investigation.”\n\n —HERBERT SPENCER\n\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n}\n
